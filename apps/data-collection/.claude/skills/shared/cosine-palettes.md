# Cosine palettes + harness API reference

Shared reference for the generate-forward / caption / judge / audit skills.

## The palette formula

A palette is `color(t) = a + b * cos(2π * (c*t + d))` evaluated per RGB channel
for t in [0,1]. The training target is 12 floats in row order:
`[a.r, a.g, a.b, b.r, b.g, b.b, c.r, c.g, c.b, d.r, d.g, d.b]`, 3 decimals.

Intuition per row:
- **a (offset)** — the base color the gradient oscillates around. Keep ~0.2–0.8.
- **b (amplitude)** — how far each channel swings. `a ± b` outside [0,1] clips
  to mud/blowout; keep |b| ≤ min(a, 1-a) + ~0.15.
- **c (frequency)** — cycles across the gradient. 0.25–1.25 is the sweet spot;
  above ~1.5 you get candy-cane banding, near 0 the channel goes flat.
- **d (phase)** — where in the cycle each channel starts (0–1 wraps). Phase
  offsets between channels are what create hue movement.

Failure modes to avoid/flag: near-black or flat palettes, heavy clipping
(consecutive identical stops at #000000/#ffffff), stripey high-frequency
palettes, gray mud (all channels nearly equal everywhere).

You may author palettes either as `{"coeffs": [12 floats]}` or as
`{"hexColors": ["#aabbcc", ...]}` (3–8 colors — the server fits coeffs and
rejects `bad-fit` when the colors don't follow a smooth cosine-like path;
smooth transitions fit well, hard neon jumps don't).

## Presentation (style / steps / angle)

`style`/`steps`/`angle` are properties of the PALETTE — how it renders best on
grabient.com. Choose them from how the palette itself reads, **never from the
query**, and **never mention presentation in query text**: queries are strictly
color exploration (colors, scenes, moods, objects — think Adobe Color search),
so "radial", "swatches", "gradient", "5 color", angle talk etc. must not appear
in any query. If you send no values the server derives sensible defaults from
palette complexity; send them when you have a better read:

- `style` — `linearGradient | linearSwatches | angularGradient |
  angularSwatches | radialGradient | radialSwatches`. Smooth atmospheric
  blends → gradients; discrete stripe-like color schemes → swatches; palettes
  with a strong center-out or glow character → radial; busy multi-hue cycles →
  angular.
- `angle` — integer 0–360, CSS convention (0 = bottom→top, 90 = left→right,
  180 = top→bottom); pick what flatters the palette's flow.
- `steps` — integer 2–50 (site default 7); swatch styles read best at 3–8,
  gradients at 6–16.

## Themes (caption only)

When captioning, also send `themes`: 3–5 free-form lowercase phrases naming
what the palette evokes ("rainy harbor", "70s kitchen", "citrus"). They steer
semantic coverage and slice evals — they are never a training target, so favor
honest associations over creative writing. Distinct from the deterministic
`tags` (those measure visual properties).

## API

All requests go through the pre-authenticated wrapper `harness/dc-api.sh` —
first argument is the API path, remaining arguments are extra curl flags:

    harness/dc-api.sh /api/coverage
    harness/dc-api.sh /api/submit/forward -X POST \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"runId": "...", ...}'

Do NOT construct curl commands with `$DC_API_URL`/`$DC_API_KEY` — env vars are
not readable in this session. Always pass the `run_id` you were invoked with
as `runId` in JSON bodies.

- `GET /api/coverage` → `{tagHistogram, queryCategoryCounts, brightnessBands,
  contrastBands, themes: {top, palettesWithoutThemes}, gaps: [{kind, value,
  count}]}` — gaps are the 12 least-covered buckets, ascending (plus a
  `themes` sparsity entry when palettes lack themes).
- `GET /api/stats` → totals per status.
- `POST /api/palettes/similar` `{coeffs?|hexColors?, topK?}` →
  `{seed, isDuplicate, exactMatch, neighbors: [{seed, distance, reversed}]}`.
  distance is average deltaE; < 8 counts as duplicate.
- `POST /api/palettes/batch` `{runId, source, palettes: [...]}` → per-item
  accepted/rejected with reasons (`duplicate` includes `nearestSeed`/`distance`).
- `POST /api/submit/forward` `{runId, query: {text, category, styleHint?},
  candidates: [...]}` → `{query: outcome, accepted, rejected}`.
  Candidates may carry `style`/`steps`/`angle` — the best-fit presentation for
  that palette (see Presentation).
  Categories: scene | mood | aesthetic | color-explicit | object | nature |
  abstract | season-weather-time. styleHint: short | verbose | typo | casual |
  emoji.

## Emoji queries

Real users type emoji into search boxes — it is a language-independent color
register. Rules for authoring them (styleHint: "emoji"):
- **Sequence = gradient order**: ⚫🟣🔴 reads dark → purple → red.
- **Repetition = proportion**: ⚫⚫⚫🟣🍎 means more than half dark, then
  purple, ending in apple-red. Palettes for it should honor the weighting,
  not just the hue list.
- Object/nature emoji mean their characteristic color or scene: 🍎 red,
  🌊 ocean blues, 🌅 sunrise, 🌿 leaf green, 🍑 peach, 🔥 fire.
- Mixes with text are natural too: "🌊 sunset", "cozy 🍂".
- Keep sequences 2–6 emoji; never use skin-tone or flag emoji.
- `POST /api/caption/lease` `{runId, limit}` → `{palettes: [{seed, hexStops,
  tags, brightness, contrast, style, steps, angle, themes}]}`.
- `POST /api/caption/submit` `{runId, seed, themes?: [string], presentation?:
  {style?, steps?, angle?}, queries: [{text, category, styleHint?}]}` →
  per-query inserted/duplicate (with existingText). Send `presentation` when
  the leased palette's current values don't fit how it actually reads (common
  for sampler-created palettes).
- `POST /api/judge/lease` `{runId, limit}` → `{pairs: [{queryId, seed,
  queryText, coeffs, hexStops, tags}]}`.
- `POST /api/judge/submit` `{runId, results: [{queryId, seed, score 0-10,
  verdict: ok|bad-match|bad-palette, ambiguity?: low|medium|high, notes?}]}`.
- `POST /api/judge/golden` `{runId, pairs: [{queryId, seed}]}` — audit only:
  flags independently re-confirmed pairs as golden eval-set members.
- `GET /api/judge/audit/sample?n=20` → scored pairs with storedScore/verdict.

## Rules for every skill

- Call the API ONLY via `harness/dc-api.sh` (pre-authenticated). Never probe
  or read env vars (`echo $VAR`, `env`, `printenv` — blocked, and there is no
  human to approve anything). If a call fails, retry it once; do not fall
  back to environment debugging or asking for approval.
- Never write repo files; only call the API (and Read rendered PNGs when told).
- Treat server rejections as information, not errors: a `duplicate` rejection
  tells you what already exists — diverge from it, don't retry cosmetically.
- Finish by printing one summary line: counts of submitted/accepted/rejected.
