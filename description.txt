What Grabient Does

AI-Generated Palettes: Type a phrase like "sunset over the ocean" or "cyberpunk neon." Vector search finds matching palettes from a library of smooth, cosine-based color gradients.

Community Library: Browse thousands of user-made and AI generated gradients. Search by keyword, color name, popularity, or newest.

Full Customization: Choose Linear Gradient, Linear Swatches, Angular Gradient, or Angular Swatches; set the angle; add 2–50 color stops; tweak each RGB channel. Live preview updates instantly.

One-Click Export: Copy CSS, download SVG, PNG, or JPEG. Export multiple gradients at once with custom grid layout, spacing, and border radius.
