<Warning>
  Looking to create a single use checkout session? Checkout Links are probably **not** what you're looking for.

  Checkout Links are shareable links that generate checkout sessions when opened. They are very handy to start a purchase from your website or social media.

  However, if you want to start a checkout for one of your user **inside** your product, you should use the [Checkout Sessions API](/api-reference/checkouts/create-session).

> client, like a desktop application or a mobile app.
> If you plan to validate a license key on a server, use the `/v1/license-keys/activate`
> endpoint instead.

<Tip>
  You only need to use this endpoint if you have device **activations** enabled on the license key benefit. You then use this endpoint to reserve an allocation for a specific device. Storing the unique activation ID from the response on the device and using it as extra validation in the [/validate](/api-reference/customer-portal/license-keys/validate) endpoint.

  Not using **activations**? Just use the [/validate](/api-reference/customer-portal/license-keys/validate) endpoint directly instead.

**Scopes**: `customer_portal:read` `customer_portal:write`

<Warning>
  Once the invoice is generated, it's permanent and cannot be modified.

  Make sure the billing details (name and address) are correct before generating the invoice. You can update them before generating the invoice by calling the [`PATCH /v1/customer-portal/orders/{id}`](/api-reference/customer-portal/orders/patch) endpoint.
</Warning>

<Note>
  After successfully calling this endpoint, you get a `202` response, meaning
  the generation of the invoice has been scheduled. It usually only takes a few
  seconds before you can retrieve the invoice using the [`GET /v1/customer-portal/orders/{id}/invoice`](/api-reference/customer-portal/orders/get-invoice) endpoint.

  If you want a reliable notification when the invoice is ready, you can listen to the
  [`order.updated`](/api-reference/webhooks/order.updated) webhook and check the [`is_invoice_generated` field](/api-reference/webhooks/order.updated#schema-data-is-invoice-generated).

## Base URLs

| Environment | Base URL                          | Purpose                         |
| ----------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Production  | `https://api.polar.sh/v1`         | Real customers & live payments  |
| Sandbox     | `https://sandbox-api.polar.sh/v1` | Safe testing & integration work |

<Info>
  The sandbox environment is fully isolated—data, users, tokens, and
  organizations created there do not affect production. Create separate tokens
  in each environment.
</Info>

Read more: [Sandbox Environment](/integrate/sandbox)

## Authentication

### Organization Access Tokens (OAT)

Use an **OAT** to act on behalf of your organization (manage products, prices, checkouts, orders, subscriptions, benefits, etc.).

```http  theme={null}
Authorization: Bearer polar_oat_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

<Tip>
  Create OATs in your organization settings. See: [Organization Access
  Tokens](/integrate/oat)
</Tip>

<Warning>
  Never expose an OAT in client-side code, public repos, or logs. If leaked, it
  will be revoked automatically by our secret scanning integrations.
</Warning>

### Customer Access Tokens

Do **not** use OATs in the browser. For customer-facing flows, [generate a **Customer Session**](/api-reference/customer-portal/sessions/create) server-side, then use the returned **customer access token** with the **Customer Portal API** to let a signed-in customer view their own orders, subscriptions, and benefits.

## Core API vs Customer Portal API

| Aspect               | Core API                                                                 | Customer Portal API                            |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Audience             | Your server / backend                                                    | One of your customer                           |
| Auth Type            | Organization Access Token (OAT)                                          | Customer Access Token                          |
| Scope                | Full org resources (products, orders, subscriptions, benefits, checkout) | Only the authenticated customer’s data         |
| Typical Use          | Admin dashboards, internal tools, automation, provisioning               | Building a custom customer portal or gated app |
| Token Creation       | Via dashboard (manual)                                                   | Via `/v1/customer-sessions/` (server-side)     |
| Sensitive Operations | Yes (create/update products, issue refunds, etc.)                        | No (read/update only what the customer owns)   |

<Note>
  The Customer Portal API is a *restricted* surface designed for safe exposure
  in user-facing contexts (after exchanging a session). It cannot perform
  privileged org-level mutations like creating products or issuing refunds.
</Note>

## Quick Examples

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash curl (Production - Core API) theme={null}
  curl https://api.polar.sh/v1/products/ \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $POLAR_OAT" \
    -H "Accept: application/json"
  ```

  ```bash curl (Sandbox - Core API) theme={null}
  curl https://sandbox-api.polar.sh/v1/products/ \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $POLAR_OAT_SANDBOX" \
    -H "Accept: application/json"
  ```

  ```bash curl (Customer Portal API) theme={null}
  curl https://api.polar.sh/v1/customer-portal/orders/ \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $POLAR_CUSTOMER_TOKEN" \
    -H "Accept: application/json"
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Using SDKs

All official SDKs accept a `server` parameter for sandbox usage:

<CodeGroup>
  ```ts TypeScript theme={null}
  import { Polar } from "@polar-sh/sdk";

  const polar = new Polar({
  accessToken: process.env.POLAR_ACCESS_TOKEN!,
  server: "sandbox", // omit or use 'production' for live
  });

  ```

  ```py Python theme={null}
  from polar import Polar

  client = Polar(
      access_token=os.environ["POLAR_ACCESS_TOKEN"],
      server="sandbox",
  )
  ```

  ```go Go theme={null}
  s := polargo.New(
    polargo.WithServer("sandbox"),
    polargo.WithSecurity(os.Getenv("POLAR_ACCESS_TOKEN")),
  )
  ```

  ```php PHP theme={null}
  $sdk = Polar\Polar::builder()
      ->setServer('sandbox')
      ->setSecurity(getenv('POLAR_ACCESS_TOKEN'))
      ->build();
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Pagination

List endpoints in the Polar API support pagination to help you efficiently retrieve large datasets. Use the `page` and `limit` query parameters to control pagination.

### Query Parameters

| Parameter | Type    | Default | Max   | Description                                      |
| --------- | ------- | ------- | ----- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `page`    | integer | `1`     | -     | Page number, starting from 1                     |
| `limit`   | integer | `10`    | `100` | Number of items to return per page (window size) |

<Info>
  The `page` parameter works as a window offset. For example, `page=2&limit=10`
  means the API will skip the first 10 elements and return the next 10.
</Info>

### Response Format

All paginated responses include a `pagination` object with metadata about the current page and total results:

| Field         | Type    | Description                                                      |
| ------------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `total_count` | integer | Total number of items matching your query across all pages       |
| `max_page`    | integer | Total number of pages available, given the current `limit` value |

### Example

Let's say you want to fetch products with a limit of 100 items per page:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash Request theme={null}
  curl https://api.polar.sh/v1/products/?page=1&limit=100 \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $POLAR_OAT" \
    -H "Accept: application/json"
  ```

  ```json Response theme={null}
  {
    "items": [
      {
        "id": "...",
        "name": "Product 1",
        ...
      },
      ...
    ],
    "pagination": {
      "total_count": 250,
      "max_page": 3
    }
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

In this example:

* `total_count=250` indicates there are 250 total products
* `limit=100` means each page contains up to 100 products
* `max_page=3` means you need to make 3 requests to retrieve all products (pages 1, 2, and 3)

<Tip>
  To retrieve all pages, increment the `page` parameter from `1` to `max_page`.
  Our SDKs provide built-in pagination helpers to automatically iterate through
  all pages.
</Tip>

## Rate Limits

Polar API has rate limits to ensure fair usage and maintain performance. The limits are as follows:

* **300 requests per minute** per organization/customer or OAuth2 Client.
* **3 requests per second** for unauthenticated license key [validation](/api-reference/customer-portal/license-keys/validate), [activation](/api-reference/customer-portal/license-keys/activate), and [deactivation](/api-reference/customer-portal/license-keys/deactivate) endpoints.

If you exceed the rate limit, you will receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response. The response will include a `Retry-After` header indicating how long you should wait before making another request.

<Note>
  Organizations requiring higher rate limits for production workloads may
  contact our support team to discuss elevated limits.

# API Changelog
Source: https://polar.sh/docs/changelog/api

Stay up to date with the latest changes, improvements and deprecations to the Polar API.

<Update label="2025-06-18">
  ## Checkout API and Customer Session API changes

  To be more consistent across our API, we've renamed `customer_external_id` field to `external_customer_id` in the Checkout API and Customer Session API.

  * <Icon icon="circle-exclamation" size={16} color="orange" /> **Deprecated**:
    `customer_external_id` field in the Checkout API and Customer Session API. Use
    `external_customer_id` instead.

  ## Benefit metadata in Customer State

  The customer state now includes the [benefit metadata](/api-reference/customers/state#response-benefit-metadata) in the `granted_benefits` list.
</Update>

<Update label="2025-06-17">
  ## Webhook API endpoints are now documented

  The API endpoints for managing webhooks are now documented in the API reference, and fully supported in our SDK.

  [Read more](/api-reference/webhooks/endpoints/create)
</Update>

<Update label="2025-06-05">
  ## Rate limits

  To ensure fair usage and maintain performance, we've introduced rate limits for the API. The limits are as follows:

  * **100 requests per second** per IP address.
</Update>

<Update label="2025-06-02">
  ## Order invoice generation and retrieval

  Until now, the invoice was generated automatically when the order was created, allowing you to call [`GET /v1/orders/{id}/invoice`](/api-reference/orders/get-invoice) and [`GET /v1/customer-portal/orders/{id}/invoice`](/api-reference/customer-portal/orders/get-invoice) endpoints without any prior action.

  We now require you to explicitly generate the invoice by calling the [`POST /v1/orders/{id}/invoice`](/api-reference/orders/post-invoice) or [`POST /v1/customer-portal/orders/{id}/invoice`](/api-reference/customer-portal/orders/post-invoice) endpoints.

  This change allows us to better handle the invoice generation process, and to allow the customer to change the billing details (name and address) before generating the invoice. This can be done through the [`PATCH /v1/orders/{id}`](/api-reference/orders/patch) or [`PATCH /v1/customer-portal/orders/{id}`](/api-reference/customer-portal/orders/patch) endpoints.
</Update>

<Update label="2025-04-16">
  ## Benefit metadata support and floating point numbers in metadata

  * <Icon icon="check" size={16} color="green" /> **Added**: Benefits now support
    [metadata](/api-reference/benefits/create#body-metadata).
  * <Icon icon="check" size={16} color="green" /> **Added**: Metadata values now
    support floating-point numbers. Before, only strings, integers and booleans
    were supported.
</Update>

<Update label="2025-03-25">
  ## Checkout amount fields changes and depreciations

  To be more consistent with the [Order schema changes](#2025-03-14), we've made some changes to the field related to amounts in the Checkout schema.

  * <Icon icon="check" size={16} color="green" /> **Added**:
    [`checkout.discount_amount`](/api-reference/checkouts/get-session#response-discount-amount).
  * <Icon icon="check" size={16} color="green" /> **Added**:
    [`checkout.net_amount`](/api-reference/checkouts/get-session#response-net-amount).
  * <Icon icon="circle-exclamation" size={16} color="orange" /> **Deprecated**:
    `checkout.subtotal_amount`, use
    [`checkout.net_amount`](/api-reference/checkouts/get-session#response-net-amount)
    instead.
</Update>

<Update label="2025-03-20">
  ## New order status and webhooks

  Until now, Polar only kept track of fully processed, **paid** orders. To help you keep track of the order lifecycle, we've added a new status `pending`, which is a transitive state meaning the order is created but not paid yet. In most cases, the order will transition from `pending` to `paid` in a short time.

  * <Icon icon="circle-exclamation" size={16} color="orange" /> When receiving
    `order.created` event, the order status might not be `paid`.
  * <Icon icon="check" size={16} color="green" /> **Added**:
    [`order.updated`](/api-reference/webhooks/order.updated) webhook, sent when
    the order status changes or when it's partially or fully refunded.
  * <Icon icon="check" size={16} color="green" /> **Added**:
    [`order.paid`](/api-reference/webhooks/order.paid) webhook, sent when the
    order is fully processed and paid.
  * <Icon icon="check" size={16} color="green" /> **Added**:
    [`Order.paid`](/api-reference/orders/get#response-paid) property to the order
    schema.

  <Info>
    If you were relying on the `order.created` webhook to keep track of succesful
    orders, we recommend you to switch to `order.paid`.
  </Info>
</Update>

<Update label="2025-03-14">
  ## Subscriptions and Orders schema changes

  To prepare our next move to support usage-based billing, we've made some changes to the [`Subscription`](/api-reference/subscriptions/get) and [`Order`](/api-reference/orders/get) schemas. The main reason behind those is that we need to support multiple prices and items in a single subscription or order.

  * <Icon icon="circle-exclamation" size={16} color="orange" /> **Deprecated**:
    `Subscription.price_id` and `Subscription.price`. Use the
    `Subscription.prices` array instead.
  * <Icon icon="circle-exclamation" size={16} color="orange" /> **Deprecated**:
    `Order.product_price_id` and `Order.product_price`. Use the `Order.items`
    array instead.
  * <Icon icon="circle-exclamation" size={16} color="orange" /> **Deprecated**:
    `Order.amount`. Use the `Order.net_amount` instead. It has the same value and
    meaning, but the new name is more explicit.
  * <Icon icon="check" size={16} color="green" /> **Added**:
    `Order.subtotal_amount`, `Order.discount_amount`, and `Order.total_amount`
    fields to provide a more detailed breakdown of the order amount.
</Update>

  A Return URL can now be set while generating a [checkout session](https://polar.sh/docs/api-reference/checkouts/create-session#body-return-url-one-of-0) or a [customer portal session](https://polar.sh/docs/api-reference/customer-portal/sessions/create#body-one-of-0-return-url-one-of-0). This allows you to preserve the context for the end users who visit either if they wish to go back to the application.

  ## Ability to search Customers via their External ID

  The [List Customers API](https://polar.sh/docs/api-reference/customers/list) now accepts Customer's External ID [in the **query** parameter](https://polar.sh/docs/api-reference/customers/list#parameter-one-of-0).

  ## Ability to disable automatic customer emails

  Via the organization settings, you can now disable the emails we automatically send to customers on certain events. This gives you the ability to own the communications with the customers.

  We're excited to introduce a chat widget to the Polar dashboard, making it easier than ever for merchants to get help directly within the product.

  ## Improved Checkout Flow for Invalid Discount Code

  Previously, if you entered an invalid discount code during checkout, you couldn't continue even after removing the code. Now, clearing the discount input lets you proceed smoothly with the checkout process.

  ## Improved Customer Portal Rate Limits

  We've made several improvements to the Customer Portal to handle authentication rate limits more gracefully:

  * The portal now clearly shows 401 and 429 errors on the OTP (one-time password) page.
  * If you hit a 429 (too many requests), you'll be redirected to a clear `/too-many-requests` page.
</Update>

<Update label="2025-10-01">
  ## Launched Subscription Trials

  You can now offer [trial periods](/docs/features/trials) for new subscriptions! This highly requested feature allows you to let customers experience your product before their first payment is due. Trials can be configured in both the dashboard and API when creating or updating subscription products.

  ## Always display taxes line item in the checkout

  We've improved our checkout experience to always display taxes (vs lazy loading them on country selection), making charges more transparent for your customers regardless of whether taxes apply to their purchase.

  ## Do not calculate taxes on free or zero-amount orders

  Orders with a zero amount (such as promotional products) will no longer have taxes calculated, resulting in a clearer and more accurate order summary for your customers.

  ## Add confirmation modal for deleting discounts

  When deleting a discount, you'll now see a confirmation modal to help prevent accidental deletions and provide extra clarity on the impact of your actions.

  ## Fix infinite rendering loop with date picker

  Resolved a bug where selecting dates in the date picker could cause an infinite rendering loop, improving reliability for date-related forms.

  ## Require opt-in if you will be charged immediately

  Users must now explicitly confirm immediate charges or credits when switching subscription intervals, with the UI providing clearer, contextual explanations of invoicing outcomes.

  ## Check for `expires_at` when activating license keys

  License key activation now correctly checks the `expires_at` date, ensuring that only valid, non-expired license keys can be activated.

  ## Fix customer state for trialing subscriptions

  The [Customer State API](/docs/api-reference/customers/state) now properly handles customers with `trialing` subscriptions, so your integrations and dashboards always show an accurate subscription status.
</Update>

<Update label="2025-09-22">
  ## Improved preview of next invoice in Customer Portal

  We've enhanced the Customer Portal to provide a clearer and more accurate preview of your next invoice. The overview now updates automatically after subscription changes, and you can preview upcoming charges with all relevant taxes and discounts included.

  ## Cancellation metrics

  We've added detailed cancellation metrics, giving you clearer insights into subscription cancellations and their impact on your business performance.
</Update>

<Update label="2025-09-12">
  ## Webhooks payload now includes timestamp

  We've updated our webhooks server implementation to [include a timestamp in each payload](https://github.com/polarsource/polar/pull/6770), in line with the Standard Webhooks specification.

  This change ensures that every webhook payload contains precise event timing, making it easier to trace and debug webhook deliveries, and to meet integration requirements for external platforms.
</Update>

<Update label="2025-09-05">
  ## Meter management improvements

  We've made it easier to manage your meters with new UI functionality for archiving and unarchiving meters directly from the dashboard.

  You can now archive meters that are no longer needed, which helps keep your meter list organized. Archived meters can be unarchived if you need to use them again. Note that meters cannot be archived if they are still attached to active products or referenced by active benefits.

  ## Metrics accuracy improvements

  We've improved the accuracy of our metrics by excluding unpaid orders from all calculations. Previously, orders in pending status were included in metrics, which could lead to inflated numbers.

  Now, only successfully paid and refunded orders are included in metrics calculations, giving you a more accurate view of your actual business performance.

  ## Enhanced customer email branding

  We've improved the branding of emails sent to your customers by using organization-specific 'From' and 'Reply-to' addresses.

  Customer emails now appear to come from your organization (e.g., "YourOrg (via Polar)") with replies directed to your organization's email address, providing a more professional and branded experience for your customers.
</Update>

<Update label="2025-06-12">
  ## Update subscription discount

  We've added the ability to update the discount on a subscription. This allows you to add, remove, or change the discount applied to a subscription at any time.

  This feature is both available through the [API](/api-reference/subscriptions/update) and the dashboard.
</Update>

<Update label="2025-06-05">
  ## Payout Reverse Invoices

  We've added the ability to generate reverse invoices for payouts directly from the Payouts page. This feature allows you to easily create an invoice that details the sales made on your behalf, minus our fees.

  [Read more](/features/finance/payouts#reverse-invoices)
</Update>

<Update label="2025-05-22">
  ## Business Purchase Option on Checkout

  We've added a new "I'm purchasing as a business" checkbox to the Checkout flow. When selected, customers are required to provide their business billing name and complete billing address.
</Update>

<Update label="2025-05-19">
  ## Enhanced Attribution for Checkout Links

  We've added support for `reference_id` and UTM parameters (`utm_source`, `utm_medium`, `utm_campaign`, `utm_content`, `utm_term`) as query parameters for Checkout Links. These parameters are automatically stored in the Checkout metadata, allowing you to track the source of your traffic and conversions more effectively.

  [Read more](/features/checkout/links#store-attribution-and-reference-metadata)
</Update>

<Update label="2025-05-15">
  ## Checkouts and payments insights

  We've added a new **Checkouts** tab under the **Sales**, where you can review all the checkout sessions, successful or not. You can filter them by customer email, status, and product. You can also see the payment attempts for each checkout session, including the reason for any failed or declined payments.

  [Better Auth](https://www.better-auth.com/) is an open source authentication framework for
  TypeScript that is quickly becoming a favorite amongst developers. Today, we're
  thrilled to have shipped a Polar plugin for Better Auth - in collaboration with them.

<Update label="2025-02-27">
  ## Customer External ID

  We've added support for an `external_id` field on Customers. We believe this will greatly simplify the reconciliation process between your system and Polar.

  Previously, the recommended way to reconcile with your users was to use `metadata`. However, this was not always the most convenient method, especially if you needed to fetch a Customer from our API.

  With `external_id`, you can now fetch a Customer directly by their external ID through dedicated `GET`, `PATCH`, and `DELETE` endpoints. You don't even need to store Polar's internal ID in your system anymore! [Read more](/features/customer-management#external-id)

  Of course, you can also directly preset `external_customer_id` when creating a Checkout Session, and it will automatically be set on the newly created Customer after a successful checkout. [Read more](/features/checkout/session#external-customer-id)

  ## Polar's take on Product variants

  We've released big changes to how we handle products and pricing, allowing us to support a unique approach to what the industry typically calls **variants** 🔥

  We believe having a single product with multiple pricing models and benefits adds unneccessary complexity to the user and to the API. Instead, we chose to treat everything as a product, giving you maximum flexibility about the pricing and benefits you want to offer.

  Thus, we introduce support for **multiple products** at checkout, allowing customers to switch between them before purchasing. Typically, you can offer a monthly and a yearly product, with specific pricing and benefits for each.

  ### Depreciations

  * Products can no longer have both a monthly and yearly pricing. Existing products still work, but you'll see a warning like this when trying to edit their pricing:

  ### API changes

  * The `product_id` and `product_price_id` fields are deprecated in the [Checkout Session API](/api-reference/checkouts/create-session). You should now use the `products` field to specify the products you want to include in the checkout.
  * The `type` and `recurring_interval` fields on `ProductPrice` are deprecated. `recurring_interval` is now set directly on `Product`.

## Crediting Usage Meter Balance

The Credits benefit will credit a customer's Usage Meter balance at different points in time depending on the type of product purchased.

### Subscription Products

The customer will be credited the amount of units specified in the benefit at the beginning of every subscription cycle period — monthly or yearly.

### One-Time Products

The customer will be credited the amount of units specified in the benefit once at the time of purchase.

## Rollover unused credits

You can choose to rollover unused credits to the next billing cycle. This means that if a customer doesn't use all of their credits in a given billing cycle, the remaining credits will be added to their balance for the next billing cycle. To enable this feature, check the "Rollover unused credits" checkbox when creating or editing the Credits benefit.

<Note>
  If you change the rollover setting for a benefit, it will only apply to new
  credits issued after the change. Existing credits will not be affected.
</Note>


# Custom Benefit
Source: https://polar.sh/docs/features/benefits/custom

Create your own Custom benefit

You can add a simple, custom benefit, which allows you to attach a note to paying customers.

## **Custom Notes**

Secret message only customers can see, e.g [Cal.com](http://Cal.com) link, private email for support etc.

For custom integrations you can also distinguish benefits granted to customers to offer even more bespoke user benefits.

## Sell Digital Products

You can easily offer customers and subscribers access to downloadable files with Polar.

* Up to 10GB per file
* Upload any type of file - from ebooks to full-fledged applications
* SHA-256 checksum validation throughout for you and your customers (if desired)
* Customers get a signed & personal downloadable URL

## Create Downloadable Benefit

1. Go to `Benefits` in the Dashboard sidebar
2. Click `+ Add Benefit` to create a new benefit
3. Choose `File Downloads` as the `Type`

You can now upload the files you want to offer as downloadables for customers.

1. Drag & drop files to the dropzone (`Feed me some bytes`)
2. Or click on that area to open a file browser

### Change filename

Click on the filename to change it inline.

### Change order of files

You can drag and drop the files in the order you want.

### Review SHA-256 checksum

Click on the contextual menu dots and then `Copy SHA-256 Checksum`

### Delete a file

Click on the contextual menu dots and then `Delete` in the menu.

**Active subscribers & customers will lose access too!**

Deleting a file permanently deletes it from Polar and our S3 buckets except for the metadata. Disable the file instead if you don't want it permanently deleted.

### Disable & Enable Files

You can disable files at any point to prevent new customers getting access to it.

**Existing customers retain their access**

Customers who purchased before the file was disabled will still have access to legacy files. Only new customers will be impacted.

**Enabling or adding files grants access retroactively**

In case you add more files or re-enable existing ones, all current customers and subscribers with the benefit will be granted access.

## Sell GitHub Repository Access

With Polar you can seamlessly offer your customers and subscribers automated access to private GitHub repositories.

* Fully automated collaborator invites
* Unlimited repositories (via multiple benefits) from your organization(s)
* Users get access upon subscribing & removed on cancellation
* Or get lifetime access upon paying a one-time price (product)

### **Use cases**

* Sponsorware
* Access to private GitHub discussions & issues for sponsors
* Early access to new feature development before upstream push
* Premium educational materials & code
* Self-hosting products
* Courses, starter kits, open core software & more...

## Create GitHub Repository Benefit

1. Go to `Benefits` in the sidebar
2. Click `+ New Benefit` to create a new benefit
3. Choose `GitHub Repository Access` as the `Type`

You first need to `Connect your GitHub Account` and install a dedicated Polar App for this benefit across the repositories you want to use it with.

* Click `Connect your GitHub Account`

<Info>
  **Why do I need to connect GitHub again and install a separate app?**

  This feature requires permission to manage repository collaborators. GitHub Apps does not support progressive permission scope requests. So instead of requesting this sensitive permission from all users (unnecessarily) in our core GitHub Login this feature uses a standalone app instead.
</Info>

Once you've authorized our dedicated GitHub App for this feature you'll be redirected back to Polar and the benefit form - now connected and updated.

### **Repository**

Select the desired repository you want to automate collaborator invites for.

<Info>
  **Why can I only connect organization repositories vs. personal ones?**

  GitHub does not support granular permissions for collaborators on personal repositories - granting them all write permissions instead. Since collaborators would then be able to push changes, releases and more, we do not support personal repositories by default.Want this still? Reach out to us and we can enable it.
</Info>

### **Role**

Select the role you want to grant collaborators.

* **Read (Default & Highly recommended)**
* Triage
* Write
* Maintain
* Admin

Read access (read-only) is what 99.9% of cases should use and the others are highly discouraged unless you have special use cases & absolutely know the impact of these permissions. Checkout the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-user-access-to-your-organizations-repositories/managing-repository-roles/repository-roles-for-an-organization#permissions-for-each-role) for reference.

<Info>
  Anyone with read access to a repository can create a pull request [(source)](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).
</Info>

<Info>
  **Additional Costs for Paid GitHub Organizations**

  GitHub treats collaborators as a seat and they will incurr charges accordingly to your billing unless you're using a free GitHub organization plan. So make sure to confirm you're on a free plan OR charge sufficiently to offset the costs you'll need to pay to GitHub.
</Info>


# Automated Benefits
Source: https://polar.sh/docs/features/benefits/introduction



Polar offers built-in benefit (entitlements) automation for common upsells within the developer &
designer ecosystem with more to come.

* [**Credits**](/features/benefits/credits). A simple benefit that allows you to credit a customer's Usage Meter balance.
* [**License Keys**](/features/benefits/license-keys). Software license keys that you can customize the branding of.
* [**File Downloads**](/features/benefits/file-downloads). Downloadable files of any kind up to 10GB each.
* [**GitHub Repository Access**](/features/benefits/github-access). Automatically invite subscribers to private GitHub repo(s).
* [**Discord Invite**](/features/benefits/discord-access). Automate invitations and granting of roles to subscribers and customers.

## Product & Subscription Benefits

Product and subscription benefits are standalone resources in Polar - connected to one or many products or subscription tiers.

This approach is a bit different from other platforms, but offers many advantages:

* Easy to enable the same benefit across multiple products & subscriptions
* You can change a benefit in one place vs. many
* No duplicate data or work (error prone)
* More intuitive UI for you and your customers

**How customers get access to benefits:**

* ✅ Active subscribers of tiers with the benefit enabled
* ✅ Customers who bought a product with the benefit (lifetime access)
* ❌ Subscribers with an expired subscription (cancelled)
* ❌ Users who are not customers

## Creating & Managing Benefits

You can manage benefits in two ways:

1. Directly within a product create/edit form
2. Or via `Benefits` in your dashboard

You can easily sell software license keys with Polar without having to deal with sales tax or hosting an API to validate them in real-time. License keys with Polar come with a lot of powerful features built-in.

* Brandable prefixes, e.g `POLAR_*****`
* Automatic expiration after `N` days, months or years
* Limited number of user activations, e.g devices
* Custom validation conditions
* Usage quotas per license key
* Automatic revokation upon cancelled subscriptions

## Create License Key Benefit

1. Go to `Benefits` in the sidebar
2. Click `+ New Benefit` to create a new benefit
3. Choose `License Keys` as the `Type`

### Custom Branding

Make your license keys standout with brandable prefixes, e.g `MYAPP_<AUTO_GENERATED_UUID4>`

### Automatic Expiration

Want license keys to expire automatically after a certain time period from when the customer bought them? No problem.

### Activation Limits

You can require license keys to be activated before future validation. A great feature in case you want to limit license key usage to a certain number of devices, IPs or other conditions.

**Enable user to deactivate instances via Polar.** Instead of building your own custom admin for customers to manage their activation instances - leave it to Polar instead.

### Usage Limit

Offering OpenAI tokens or anything else with a variable usage cost? You can set a custom usage quota per license key and increment usage upon validation.

## Customer Experience

Once customers buy your product or subscribes to your tier, they will automatically receive a unique license key. It's easily accessible to them under their purchases page.

Customers can:

* View & copy their license key
* See expiration date (if applicable)
* See usage left (if applicable)
* Deactivate activations (if enabled)

## Integrate API

It's super easy and straightforward to integrate Polar license keys into your application, library or API.

### Activate License Keys (Optional)

In case you've setup license keys to have a maximum amount of activation instances, e.g user devices. You'll then need to create an activation instance prior to validating license keys / activation.

**No activation limit?** You can skip this step.

```bash Terminal theme={null}
curl -X POST https://api.polar.sh/v1/customer-portal/license-keys/activate

Validate `benefit_id` in case of multiple license keys

We require `organization_id` to be provided to avoid cases of Polar license keys being used across Polar organizations erroneously. Otherwise, a valid license key for one organization could be used on another.However, you are required to validate and scope license keys more narrowly within your organization if necessary. Offering more than one type of license key? Be sure to validate their unique benefit\_id in the responses.

You can either copy and paste our code snippet to get up and running in a second or use our JavaScript library for more advanced integrations. Our embedded checkout allows you to provide a seamless purchasing experience without redirecting users away from your site.

## Code Snippet

The code snippet can be used on any website or CMS that allows you to insert HTML.

First, create a [Checkout Link](/features/checkout/links) as described in the previous section. The code snippet can directly be copied from there by clicking on `Copy Embed Code`.

The snippet looks like this:

```typescript  theme={null}
<a
  href="__CHECKOUT_LINK__"
  data-polar-checkout
  data-polar-checkout-theme="light"
>
  Purchase
</a>
<script
  src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@polar-sh/checkout@0.1/dist/embed.global.js"
  defer
  data-auto-init
></script>
```

This will display a `Purchase` link which will open an inline checkout when clicked.

You can style the trigger element any way you want, as long as you keep the `data-polar-checkout` attribute.

## Import Library

If you have a more advanced project in JavaScript, like a React app, adding the `<script>` tag may not be an option. In this case, you can install our dedicated library.

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash npm theme={null}
  npm install @polar-sh/checkout
  ```

  ```bash pnpm theme={null}
  pnpm add @polar-sh/checkout
  ```

  ```bash yarn theme={null}
  yarn add @polar-sh/checkout
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Then, you should import the `PolarEmbedCheckout` helper class and manually call `PolarEmbedCheckout.init()`. This will add the required handlers on elements having the `data-polar-checkout` attribute.

Here is an example in React:

```ts  theme={null}
import { PolarEmbedCheckout } from '@polar-sh/checkout/embed'
import { useEffect } from 'react'

const PurchaseLink = () => {
  useEffect(() => {
    PolarEmbedCheckout.init()
  }, [])

  return (
    <a
      href="__CHECKOUT_LINK__"
      data-polar-checkout
      data-polar-checkout-theme="light"
    >
      Purchase
    </a>
  )
}

export default PurchaseLink
```

<Tip>
  Instead of a Checkout Link, you can also use a [Checkout Session](/features/checkout/session) URL created dynamically from the API.

  For this to work, make sure to set the [`embed_origin`](/api-reference/checkouts/create-session#body-embed-origin) parameter correctly when creating the Checkout Session. For example, if your checkout page is served on the URL `https://example.com/checkout`, you should set `embed_origin` to `https://example.com`.
</Tip>

## Advanced Integration

For users who need more control over the embedded checkout flow, the `PolarEmbedCheckout` class provides several advanced features.

### Programmatically creating an embed

Instead of using declarative triggers with `data-polar-checkout` attributes, you can programmatically create and control checkout instances:

```ts  theme={null}
import { PolarEmbedCheckout } from "@polar-sh/checkout/embed";

// Open checkout programmatically when needed
const openCheckout = async () => {
  const checkoutLink = "__CHECKOUT_LINK__";
  const theme = "light"; // or 'dark'

  try {
    // This creates the checkout iframe and returns a Promise
    // that resolves when the checkout is fully loaded
    const checkout = await PolarEmbedCheckout.create(checkoutLink, theme);

    // Now you can interact with the checkout instance
    return checkout;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Failed to open checkout", error);
  }
};

// Example: Trigger checkout when a button is clicked
document.getElementById("buy-button").addEventListener("click", () => {
  openCheckout();
});
```

### Listening for checkout events

You can listen for checkout events to respond to user interactions:

```ts  theme={null}
import { PolarEmbedCheckout } from "@polar-sh/checkout/embed";

const openCheckoutWithEvents = async () => {
  const checkout = await PolarEmbedCheckout.create("__CHECKOUT_LINK__");

  // Listen for when the checkout is loaded
  checkout.addEventListener("loaded", (event) => {
    console.log("Checkout loaded");
    // Call event.preventDefault() if you want to prevent the standard behavior
    // event.preventDefault()
    // Note: This would prevent removing the loader if it's still visible
  });

  // Listen for when the checkout has been closed
  checkout.addEventListener("close", (event) => {
    console.log("Checkout has been closed");
    // Call event.preventDefault() if you want to prevent the standard behavior
    // event.preventDefault()
  });

  // Listen for when the checkout has been confirmed (payment processing)
  checkout.addEventListener("confirmed", (event) => {
    console.log("Order confirmed, processing payment");
    // Call event.preventDefault() if you want to prevent the standard behavior
    // event.preventDefault()
    // Note: This would prevent setting the checkout as non-closable
  });

  // Listen for successful completion
  checkout.addEventListener("success", (event) => {
    console.log("Purchase successful!", event.detail);

    // Call event.preventDefault() if you want to prevent the standard behavior
    // event.preventDefault()
    // Note: For success event, this prevents automatic redirection if redirect is true

    // If redirect is false, you can show your own success message
    if (!event.detail.redirect) {
      showSuccessMessage();
    }
    // Otherwise, the user will be redirected to the success URL (unless prevented)
  });

  return checkout;
};
```

### React Integration with event handling

Here's a more complete React example that handles checkout events:

```ts  theme={null}
import { PolarEmbedCheckout } from '@polar-sh/checkout/embed'
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react'

const CheckoutButton = () => {
  const [checkoutInstance, setCheckoutInstance] = useState(null)

  // Clean up checkout instance on unmount
  useEffect(() => {
    return () => {
      if (checkoutInstance) {
        checkoutInstance.close()
      }
    }
  }, [checkoutInstance])

  const handleCheckout = async () => {
      try {
        const checkout = await PolarEmbedCheckout.create(
          '__CHECKOUT_LINK__',
          'light'
        )

      setCheckoutInstance(checkout)

      checkout.addEventListener('success', (event) => {
        // Track successful purchase
        analytics.track('Purchase Completed', {
          productId: 'your-product-id',
          // Add other analytics data
        })

        // Show success message or redirect
        if (!event.detail.redirect) {
          // Handle success in your app
        }
      })

      checkout.addEventListener('close', (event) => {
        // Clean up our reference when checkout is closed
        setCheckoutInstance(null)
      })
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Failed to open checkout', error)
    }
  }

  return (
    <button onClick={handleCheckout}>
      Complete Purchase
    </button>
  )
}

export default CheckoutButton
```

### Programmatically closing checkout

In some cases, you might need to programmatically close the checkout - for instance, if you detect that a user needs to take an action elsewhere in your application first:

```ts  theme={null}
import { PolarEmbedCheckout } from "@polar-sh/checkout/embed";

// Example: open checkout and store the instance
let activeCheckout = null;

async function openCheckout() {
  const checkout = await PolarEmbedCheckout.create("__CHECKOUT_LINK__");
  activeCheckout = checkout;
  return checkout;
}

// Later, close it programmatically when needed
function closeCheckout() {
  if (activeCheckout) {
    activeCheckout.close();
    // The 'close' event will fire automatically
    // Don't set activeCheckout to null here, as we'll handle that in the event listener
  }
}

// Add a listener to update our reference when checkout is closed
function setupCheckout(checkout) {
  checkout.addEventListener("close", (event) => {
    // Reset our reference when checkout is closed
    activeCheckout = null;
  });
  return checkout;
}

// Example usage
document.getElementById("open-checkout").addEventListener("click", async () => {
  const checkout = await openCheckout();
  setupCheckout(checkout);
});
document
  .getElementById("close-checkout")
  .addEventListener("click", closeCheckout);
```

## Enabling Wallet Payment Methods (Apple Pay, Google Pay, etc.)

Wallet payment methods such as Apple Pay and Google Pay are supported in the checkout with the following conditions:

* **Apple Pay** appears automatically in the checkout if:
  * The user is on an Apple device
  * The browser is Safari
  * The device is connected to an Apple account with Apple Pay configured

* **Google Pay** appears automatically in the checkout if:
  * The user is on Google Chrome
  * The browser is connected to a Google account with Google Pay configured

**No additional action is required** if you meet these conditions and are not using an embedded checkout.

### Enabling Wallet Payments for Embedded Checkout

By default, wallet payment methods (Apple Pay, Google Pay, etc.) are **not enabled** when you embed our checkout form into your website. For security reasons, your website domain needs to be manually validated before enabling these payment methods in embedded mode.

To enable wallet payment methods on your embedded checkout, please [email us](mailto:support@polar.sh) with:

* Your organization slug
* The domain you wish to allow for wallet payments


# Checkout Links
Source: https://polar.sh/docs/features/checkout/links

Sell your digital products with ease by sharing a checkout link to select products

Checkout links can be shared or linked on your website which automatically
creates a checkout session for customers.

<Tip>
  Looking for a way to generate Checkout session programmatically? Checkout
  Links might not be the right tool for you. Instead, you should use the
  [Checkout API](/features/checkout/session).
</Tip>

## Create a Checkout Link

Checkout Links can be managed from the **Checkout Links** tabs of the Products section. Click on **New Link** to create a new one.

#### Discount

You can disable discount codes, if you wish to prevent customers from using them.

You can also preset a discount: it'll be automatically applied when the customer lands on the checkout page.

#### Metadata

This is an optional key-value object allowing you to store additional information which may be useful for you when handling the order. This metadata will be copied to the generated Checkout object and, if the checkout succeeds, to the resulting Order and/or Subscription.

## Using Checkout Links

You can share the Checkout Link URL on your webpage, social media, or directly to customers.

<Warning>
  Checkout Links will go against our API, and redirect to short-lived Checkout session. This means that the Checkout page the user will end up on, are temporary and expires after a while if no successful purchase is made.

  This means that you need to make sure to always use this Checkout Link URL (as shown above). If you mistakenly copy the URL from a Checkout Session, the link will expire.
</Warning>

### Query parameters

# Checkout API
Source: https://polar.sh/docs/features/checkout/session

Create checkout sessions programmatically for complete control

If you want to integrate more deeply the checkout process with your website or application, you can use our dedicated API.

The first step is to [create a Checkout session](/api-reference/checkouts/create-session). For this you'll need at least your **Product ID**.

You can retrieve your Product ID from Products in your dashboard, click on "context-menu" button in front of your product and click on Copy Product ID.

The API will return you an object containing all the information about the session, including **an URL where you should redirect your customer** so they can complete their order.

## Multiple products

You can create a checkout session with multiple products. This is useful if you want to allow your customers to choose between different products before they checkout.

## Ad-hoc prices

For advanced use cases where you need complete control over pricing, you can create ad-hoc prices directly when creating a checkout session. Ad-hoc prices are temporary prices that exist only for that specific checkout session and don't appear in your product's catalog.

This is useful when you need to:

* Apply dynamic pricing based on user-specific factors
* Create custom pricing tiers for specific customers
* Implement usage-based or calculated pricing that varies per checkout
* Test pricing variations without modifying your product catalog

When creating a checkout session, you can pass a `prices` parameter that maps product IDs to an array of price definitions. These prices will be created on-the-fly and associated with the checkout session.

<Note>
  Ad-hoc prices are marked with `source: "ad_hoc"` in the API response, while catalog prices have `source: "catalog"`. Ad-hoc prices are temporary and specific to the checkout session.
</Note>

                  {
                      "amount_type": "fixed",
                      "price_amount": 10000,  # $100.00
                      "price_currency": "usd",
                  }
              ]
          }
      })

      print(checkout.url)
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Price types

Ad-hoc prices support all the same price types as catalog prices:

* **Fixed**: A fixed amount price
* **Custom**: Pay-what-you-want pricing
* **Free**: No charge
* **Seat-based**: Pricing based on number of seats
* **Metered**: Usage-based pricing tied to a meter

For the complete schema of each price type, refer to the [Checkout API reference](/api-reference/checkouts/create-session).

## External Customer ID

Quite often, you'll have your own users management system in your application, where your customer already have an ID. To ease reconciliation between Polar and your system, you can inform us about your customer ID when creating a checkout session through the [`external_customer_id`](/api-reference/checkouts/create-session/) field.

After a successful checkout, we'll create a Customer on Polar with the external ID you provided. It'll be provided through the `customer.external_id` property in webhooks you may have configured.

## SDK examples

Using our SDK, creating a checkout session is quite straightforward.

<CodeGroup>
  ```ts TypeScript theme={null}
  import { Polar } from "@polar-sh/sdk";

  const polar = new Polar({
    accessToken: process.env["POLAR_ACCESS_TOKEN"] ?? "",
  });

  async function run() {
    const checkout = await polar.checkouts.create({
      products: ["productId"]
    });

    console.log(checkout.url)
  }

  run();
  ```

  ```py Python theme={null}
  from polar_sdk import Polar

  with Polar(
      access_token="<YOUR_BEARER_TOKEN_HERE>",
  ) as polar:

      checkout = polar.checkouts.create(request={
          "allow_discount_codes": True,
          "product_id": "<value>",
      })

      print(checkout.url)
  ```
</CodeGroup>


# Cost Events
Source: https://polar.sh/docs/features/cost-insights/cost-events

Track costs by adding cost metadata to your ingested events

Cost Insights works by allowing you to add a special `_cost` property to any event you ingest through Polar's Event Ingestion API. These costs are then aggregated and made available through the Metrics API alongside revenue metrics.

## The `_cost` Property

### Basic Structure

To track costs, add a `_cost` property to your event's metadata when ingesting events.

```typescript icon="square-js" TypeScript (SDK) theme={null}
import { Polar } from "@polar-sh/sdk";

const polar = new Polar({
  accessToken: process.env.POLAR_ACCESS_TOKEN,
});

await polar.events.ingest({
  events: [
    {
      name: "llm.inference",
      externalCustomerId: "user_123",
      metadata: {
        _cost: {
          amount: 0.025,
          currency: "usd",
        },
      },
    },
  ],
});
```

```json cURL theme={null}
POST https://api.polar.sh/v1/events/ingest
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN

{
  "events": [
    {
      "name": "llm.inference",
      "external_customer_id": "user_123",
      "metadata": {
        "_cost": {
          "amount": 0.025,
          "currency": "usd"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Cost Metadata Schema

The `_cost` property has the following structure:

* **`amount`** (required): The cost amount in cents as a decimal number

  * Example: `0.025` for \$0.00025 (a fraction of a cent)
  * Example: `150` for \$1.50
  * Supports up to 17 digits with 12 decimal places for precision

* **`currency`** (required): The currency code
  * Currently only `"usd"` is supported

<Info>
  **Amount must be in cents**: The `amount` field represents the cost in cents,
  not dollars. For example, `100 = $1.00`, `0.5 = $0.005` (half a cent), and
  `0.001 = $0.00001` (one hundredth of a cent).
</Info>

## Use Cases

### AI/LLM Applications

Track the cost of LLM API calls per customer:

```typescript icon="square-js" TypeScript theme={null}
import { Polar } from "@polar-sh/sdk";
import OpenAI from "openai";

const polar = new Polar({
  accessToken: process.env.POLAR_ACCESS_TOKEN,
});

const openai = new OpenAI({
  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
});

// Make LLM API call
const completion = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  model: "gpt-4",
  messages: [{ role: "user", content: "Hello!" }],
});

// Calculate cost (example: $0.03 per 1K input tokens, $0.06 per 1K output tokens)
const inputCost = ((completion.usage.prompt * tokens) / 1000) * 3; // in cents
const outputCost = ((completion.usage.completion * tokens) / 1000) * 6; // in cents
const totalCost = inputCost + outputCost;

// Track the cost in Polar
await polar.events.ingest({
  events: [
    {
      name: "gpt4.completion",
      customerId: "cus_abc123",
      metadata: {
        _cost: {
          amount: totalCost,
          currency: "usd",
        },
        _llm: {
          vendor: "openai",
          model: "gpt-4",
          input_tokens: completion.usage.prompt_tokens,
          output_tokens: completion.usage.completion_tokens,
          total_tokens: completion.usage.total_tokens,
        },
      },
    },
  ],
});
```

### Infrastructure Costs

Track compute, storage, or API costs:

```json  theme={null}
{
  "events": [
    {
      "name": "video.processing",
      "external_customer_id": "user_123",
      "metadata": {
        "_cost": {
          "amount": 45.5, // $0.455
          "currency": "usd"
        },
        "duration_seconds": 120,
        "resolution": "1080p"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Third-Party Service Costs

Track costs from external services:

```json  theme={null}
{
  "events": [
    {
      "name": "email.sent",
      "external_customer_id": "user_123",
      "metadata": {
        "_cost": {
          "amount": 0.0001, // $0.000001
          "currency": "usd"
        },
        "provider": "sendgrid",
        "recipients": 1
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Best Practices

### Track Costs in Real-Time

Ingest cost events as they occur to maintain accurate, up-to-date metrics:

```typescript icon="square-js" TypeScript theme={null}
import { Polar } from "@polar-sh/sdk";

const polar = new Polar({
  accessToken: process.env.POLAR_ACCESS_TOKEN,
});

// When making an LLM API call
const completion = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  model: "gpt-4",
  messages: [{ role: "user", content: "Hello!" }],
});

const cost = calculateCost(completion.usage); // Cost should be in cents

await polar.events.ingest({
  events: [
    {
      name: "llm.completion",
      externalCustomerId: "user_123",
      metadata: {
        _cost: {
          amount: cost,
          currency: "usd",
        },
      },
    },
  ],
});
```

### Use Precise Amounts

The `amount` field supports up to 12 decimal places, perfect for tracking micro-costs:

```json  theme={null}
{
  "_cost": {
    "amount": 0.000125, // $0.00000125
    "currency": "usd"
  }
}
```

### Add Context with Additional Metadata

Combine `_cost` with other metadata to understand cost drivers:

```json  theme={null}
{
  "metadata": {
    "_cost": {
      "amount": 0.05, // $0.0005
      "currency": "usd"
    },
    "model": "gpt-4-turbo",
    "tokens": 1000,
    "feature": "chatbot"
  }
}
```

Cost Insights is a powerful feature that enables you to calculate business-centric metrics like Costs, Profits, and Customer Lifetime Value (LTV) by annotating your events with cost data.

<Note>
  Cost Insights is currently in beta. You may enable it in your organization
  settings.
</Note>

## Overview

While Polar automatically tracks revenue from orders and subscriptions, Cost Insights allows you to track the costs associated with delivering your product or service. By combining revenue and cost data, you can gain deep insights into profitability on a per-customer basis.

## How It Works

Cost Insights works in three simple steps:

1. **Ingest events with cost data**: Add a `_cost` property to events metadata when ingesting them through Polar's Event Ingestion API
2. **Automatic aggregation**: Polar automatically aggregates costs alongside your revenue data
3. **Query and analyze**: Use the Metrics API, or the Polar Dashboard to retrieve costs, profits, and customer LTV

### Quick Example

```json  theme={null}
{
  "events": [
    {
      "name": "llm.inference",
      "external_customer_id": "user_123",
      "metadata": {
        "_cost": {
          "amount": 0.025, // $0.00025 in cents
          "currency": "usd"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Common Use Cases

* **AI/LLM Applications**: Track the cost of API calls to OpenAI, Anthropic, or other LLM providers
* **Infrastructure Costs**: Monitor compute, storage, or bandwidth costs per customer
* **Third-Party Services**: Track costs from email providers, SMS gateways, or other external services
* **Customer Profitability**: Calculate profit margins and LTV for each customer

# Custom Fields
Source: https://polar.sh/docs/features/custom-fields

Learn how to add custom input fields to your checkout with Polar

By default, the Checkout form will only ask basic information from the customer to fulfill the order: a name, an email address, billing information, etc. But you might need more! A few examples:

* A checkbox asking the customer to accept your terms
* An opt-in newsletter consent
* A select menu to ask where they heard from you
* ...

With Polar, you can easily add such fields to your checkout using **Custom Fields**.

## Create Custom Fields

Custom Fields are managed at an organization's level. To create them, go to **Settings** and **Custom Fields**. You'll see the list of all the available fields on your organization.

Click on **New Custom Field** to create a new one.

### Type

The type of the field is the most important thing to select. It determines what type of input will be displayed to the customer during checkout.

The type can't be changed after the field is created.

We support five types of fields:

#### Text

This will display a simple text field to input textual data. By default, it'll render a simple input field but you can render a **textarea** by toggling the option under `Form input options`.

Under `Validation constraints`, you can add minimum and maximum length validation.

Underneath, the data will be stored as a string.

#### Number

This will display a number input field. Under `Validation constraints`, you can add minimum and maximum validation.

Underneath, the data will be stored as a number.

#### Date

This will display a date input field. Under `Validation constraints`, you can add minimum and maximum validation.

Underneath, the data will be stored as a string using the ISO 8601 format.

#### Checkbox

This will display a checkbox field.

Underneath, the data will be stored as a boolean (`true` or `false`).

#### Select

This will display a select field with a predefined set of options. Each option is a pair of `Value` and `Label`, the first one being the value that'll be stored underneath and the latter the one that will be shown to the customer.

### Slug and name

The slug determines the key that'll be used to store the data inside objects related to the checkout, like Orders and Subscriptions. It must be unique across your organization. You can change it afterwards, we'll automatically update the data to reflect the new slug.

The name is what we'll be displayed to you to recognize the field across your dashboard. By default, it'll also be the label of the field displayed to the customer, unless you customize it under `Form input options`.

### Form input options

Those options allow you to customize how the field is displayed to the customer. You can set:

* The label, displayed above the field
* The help text, displayed below the field
* The placeholder, displayed inside the field when there is no value

The label and help text supports basic Markdown syntax, so you can add bold, italic or even links.

## Managing Customers

Polar has a built in feature to view and manage your Customers.

Everyone who has ever purchased something from you will be recorded as a Customer to your Organization. You’re able to see past orders and their ongoing subscriptions, as well as some additional metrics.

## External ID

Quite often, you'll have our own users management system in your application, where your customer already have an ID. To ease reconciliation between Polar and your system, we have a dedicated [`external_id`](/api-reference/customers/get-external#response-external-id) field on Customers. It's unique across your organization and can't be changed once set.

We have dedicated API endpoints that work with the `external_id` field, so you don't even have to store the internal Polar ID in your system.

<Card title="Get Customer by External ID" icon="link" href="/api-reference/customers/get-external" horizontal />

<Card title="Update Customer by External ID" icon="link" href="/api-reference/customers/update-external" horizontal />

<Card title="Delete Customer by External ID" icon="link" href="/api-reference/customers/delete-external" horizontal />

## Metadata

You may set additional metadata on Customers. This can be very useful to store additional data about your customer you want to be available through our API and webhooks.

It can be set through the dashboard or through the [API](/api-reference/customers/update#body-metadata). It can also be pre-set when creating a Checkout Session by using the [`customer_metadata`](/api-reference/checkouts/create-session#body-customer-metadata) field. This way, after a successful checkout, the metadata will automatically be set on the newly created Customer.

Customer Portal Sign In

## Creating an authenticated Customer Portal Link

You can provide a pre-authenticated Customer Portal Link to your customers. This is handy if you want to redirect them directly from your application.

Using the Polar API, all you need is to call the `customerSessions` endpoint. Here’s an example using our TypeScript SDK.

```typescript  theme={null}
import { Polar } from "@polar-sh/sdk";

const polar = new Polar({
  accessToken: process.env["POLAR_ACCESS_TOKEN"] ?? "",
});

async function run() {
  const result = await polar.customerSessions.create({
    customerId: "<value>",
  });

  redirect(result.customerPortalUrl)
}

run();
```

Or, if you use Next.js as your framework, we have a handy utility which shortens down your code significantly.

```typescript  theme={null}
// app/portal/route.ts
import { CustomerPortal } from "@polar-sh/nextjs";

export const GET = CustomerPortal({
  accessToken: process.env.POLAR_ACCESS_TOKEN,
  getCustomerId: async (req) => '<value>',
  server: 'sandbox' // Use sandbox if you're testing Polar - pass 'production' otherwise
});
```

Your balance is all the earnings minus:

1. Any VAT we've captured for remittance, i.e balance is excluding VAT
2. Our revenue share (4% + 40¢)

All historic transactions are available in chronological order along with their associated fees that have been deducted.

Note: Upon [payout (withdrawal)](/features/finance/payouts), Stripe incurs additional fees that will be deducted before the final payout of the balance.


# Payouts
Source: https://polar.sh/docs/features/finance/payouts

Easily withdraw money from your Polar account at any time

You can issue a withdrawal, i.e payout, at any time once your balance meets the minimum threshold for your account currency. We will then transfer the balance minus Stripe payout fees (see below) to your Stripe account & issue a payout on their side.

## Minimum Payout Thresholds

The minimum balance required to issue a payout varies based out the payout currency. Certain currencies having a higher limit due to Stripe requirements. These limits can change at a later point.

## Manual Withdrawal

We require this to be done manually since:

1. Users have requested control for easier accounting vs. frequent & small payouts
2. Giving users control of Stripe payout fees

## **Stripe Payout Fees**

1. \$2 per month of active payout(s)
2. 0.25% + \$0.25 per payout
3. Cross border fees (currency conversion): 0.25% (EU) - 1% in other countries.

Given the fixed costs, we want to default to manual payouts so you can control when you want to incur them and do it once vs. per each individual transaction in order to reduce the overall fees.

## Reverse invoices

Since we're the Merchant of Record, your customers get an invoice from Polar. Thus, for your accounting, you need to issue an invoice to Polar for the amount we paid out to you. To ease this process, we can automatically generate a **reverse invoice** for you, detailing the sells we made on your behalf, minus our fees.

You can generate them from the **Payouts** page under **Finance** in your Polar dashboard. Click on the ellipsis next to the payout you want to generate a reverse invoice for, and select **Download invoice**.

# Affonso Affiliates with Polar
Source: https://polar.sh/docs/features/integrations/affonso



This guide explains how to integrate
[Affonso](https://affonso.io)'s affiliate marketing software with your Polar
account to track and manage affiliate-driven sales for your SaaS business.

## What is Affonso?

[Affonso](https://affonso.io) is an affiliate marketing software that enables SaaS businesses to launch, manage, and scale their own affiliate programs. With Affonso, you can:

* Set up flexible commission structures
* Manage multiple affiliate programs from one dashboard
* Provide your affiliates with real-time tracking and marketing resources
* Automate affiliate payments and commission calculations

## Integration Steps

### 1. Create a Polar Access Token for Affonso

First, you'll need to create an API token in Polar that Affonso can use to communicate with your account:

1. Login to your **Polar Dashboard**
2. Navigate to **Settings** in the main menu
3. Scroll down to the **Developers** section on the Settings page
4. Click the **New token** button
5. Give your token a name (e.g., "Affonso Integration")
6. Set token expiration to **No expiration**
   Important: If you set an expiration date, you'll need to manually update the token in Affonso when it expires. Tracking will stop working if the token expires.
7. Enable all the following scopes:
   * discounts:read
   * discounts:write
   * events:read
   * subscriptions:read
   * customers:read
   * customers:write
   * orders:read
   * refunds:read
   * webhooks:read
   * webhooks:write
8. Click **Create token** and copy the generated token
9. Provide this token to Affonso by entering it [in their integration settings](https://affonso.io/app/affiliate-program/connect)

</video>

### 2. Set Up Webhooks in Polar

After connecting your Polar account with Affonso, you'll [receive a webhook URL and secret from Affonso](https://affonso.io/app/affiliate-program/connect). Add these to your Polar account:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Developers** → **Webhooks** in your Polar Dashboard
2. Click the **"Add Endpoint"** button
3. In the URL field, paste the webhook URL provided by Affonso
4. For Format, select **RAW** from the dropdown
5. In the Secret field, paste the webhook secret provided by Affonso
6. Under Events, enable all of the following:
   * `order.created`
   * `order.refunded`
   * `subscription.canceled`
7. Click **Save** to complete the webhook setup

<video controls width="600">
  <source src="https://affonso-videos.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/Connect_Polar_Affonso_2.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video>

### 3. Add the Affonso Tracking Script to Your Website

Add Affonso's tracking script to the `<head>` tag of your website:

```html  theme={null}
<!-- Place in <head> tag -->
<script
  async
  defer
  src="https://affonso.io/js/pixel.min.js"
  data-affonso="YOUR_AFFONSO_PROGRAM_ID"
  data-cookie_duration="YOUR_COOKIE_DURATION">
</script>
```

Replace `YOUR_AFFONSO_PROGRAM_ID` with the unique program ID provided by Affonso.

This script should be placed on all pages of your website, including:

* Your main marketing website
* Your application domain
* Any subdomains where users might land or make purchases

### 4. Track User Signups (Optional)

For better conversion insights, you can track when users sign up through an affiliate link:

```javascript  theme={null}
// After successful registration
window.Affonso.signup(userEmail);
```

### 5. Pass Referral Data to Polar Checkout

To ensure proper commission attribution, pass the referral data when creating checkout sessions:

```javascript  theme={null}
// Get the referral ID from the Affonso global variable
const referralId = window.affonso_referral;

// Create checkout session with Polar
const checkout = await polar.checkouts.create({
  products: ["your_product_id"],
  success_url: "https://your-site.com/success",
  metadata: {
    affonso_referral: referralId, // Include referral ID from Affonso
  }
});

// Redirect to checkout
window.location.href = checkout.url;
```

## How It Works

1. When a user visits your site through an affiliate link, Affonso's script stores a unique identifier in a cookie
2. If you've implemented signup tracking, Affonso records when the user creates an account
3. When the user makes a purchase, the referral ID is passed to Polar as metadata
4. Polar's webhook notifies Affonso about the purchase

## What is Fernand?

[Fernand](https://getfernand.com/) is a modern customer support tool designed for SaaS — it’s fast, calm, and built to reduce the anxiety of answering support requests.

## How it works

### Configure Deals

Let's configure our deal settings.

* Enter your website URL (requires your own site vs. Polar storefront)
* Enter a targeted URL path, e.g `/pricing` to only show deals on that page

Now we can configure the deals for different countries. ParityDeals offers great defaults, but you can of course change them.

### Configure Banner

[Zapier](https://zapier.com/apps/polar/integrations) lets you connect Polar to 2,000+ other web services. Automated connections called Zaps, set up in minutes with no coding, can automate your day-to-day tasks and build workflows between apps that otherwise wouldn't be possible.

Each Zap has one app as the **Trigger**, where your information comes from and which causes one or more **Actions** in other apps, where your data gets sent automatically.

<Note>
  We've focused on **triggers** (webhooks) for now, so you can react to events in Polar and trigger actions in other apps.

  Need to perform actions in Polar? Tell us about your use case [here](https://github.com/orgs/polarsource/discussions/new?category=integrations\&labels=integrations%2Fzapier) and we'll consider adding more actions in the future.

You can also have an overview of all checkout sessions. You can filter them by customer email, status and product.

A checkout can be in the following states:

* Open: The checkout session is open and waiting for the customer to complete the payment.
* Confirmed: The customer clicked the **Pay** or **Subscribe** button and the payment is being processed.
* Succeeded: The payment was successful and the order was created.
* Expired: The checkout session expired and the customer can no longer complete it. A new checkout session must be created.

If you click on a Checkout, you can have more details on the **payment attempts**, in particular, why a payment has failed or has been declined.

* **Name** The title of your product.
* **Description** Markdown is supported here too.

### Pricing

Determine how you want to charge your customers for this product.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Billing cycle">
    * **One-time purchase** Customer is charged once and gets access to the product forever.
    * **Monthly** Customer is charged every month.
    * **Yearly** Customer is charged every year.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Pricing type">
    * **Fixed price** Set a fixed price for the product.
    * **Pay what you want** Let customers decide how much they want to pay.
    * **Free** No charge for the product.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Price">
    For fixed price products, set the amount you want to charge.

    For pay what you want products, you can set a minimum amount and a default amount that will be preset on checkout.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
  Billing cycle and pricing type cannot be changed after the product is created.
</Info>

<Info>
  **What if I want both a monthly and yearly pricing?**

  Polar has a unique approach to what the industry typically calls **variants**. Each product has a single pricing model, but you can create multiple products with different pricing models, and showcase them both at checkout.
</Info>

### Trial Period

For recurring products, you can set a trial period during which the customer won't be charged. Toggle **Enable trial period** to enable it. Then, you'll be able to set the duration of the trial period, given a number and a unit (days, weeks, months or years).

You can read more about how trials work [here](/features/trials).

### Product Media

* You can upload public product images to be displayed on product pages
* They can be up to 10MB each
* You can remove and re-arrange images

### Checkout Fields

You can collect additional information from your customers at checkout. This can be useful for things like phone number, terms of service agreement or specific data you need to collect.

Fields are managed from your organization settings, and you can choose which fields to show on a per-product basis, and set if they are required or not. We support the following field types:

* Text
* Number
* Date
* Checkbox
* Select

<Info>
  If you make a checkbox **required**, the customer will need to check it before
  confirming their purchase. Very handy for legal terms!
</Info>

The data collected will be available in the order and subscription details.

### Automated Entitlements

Finally, you can enable or create new entitlements (what we call Benefits) that you tie to the product.

Read more in our [product benefits guide](/features/benefits/introduction) on how they work and how to customize the built-in ones we offer:

* License Keys
* Discord Server Role
* GitHub Repository Access
* File Downloads
* Custom Benefit

## Variants

Polar has a unique approach regarding what the industry typically calls **variants**.

We believe having a single product with multiple pricing models and benefits adds unnecessary complexity to the user and to the API. Instead, we chose to treat everything as a product, giving you maximum flexibility about the pricing and benefits you want to offer.

You can showcase several products at checkout, allowing the customer to switch between them. Typically, you can offer a monthly and a yearly product, with specific pricing and benefits for each. Read more about how to do so using [Checkout Links](/features/checkout/links) or the [Checkout Session API](/features/checkout/session).

## Update a product

You can edit any product details, except the **billing cycle** and **pricing type**.

For fixed price products, you can change the price. Existing subscribers will remain on their current pricing.

If you add benefits, existing subscribers will get them automatically. If you remove benefits, existing subscribers will lose access to them.

## Archive a product

Products on Polar can't be deleted, but they can be **archived**. You can do so by clicking the **Archive** button on the bottom right of the product page.

Existing customers will keep their access to the product, and subscriptions will continue to renew. However, the product will no longer be available for new purchases.

It's possible to unarchive a product using the [Products Update API](/api-reference/products/update#body-is-archived).


# Manage Refunds
Source: https://polar.sh/docs/features/refunds

You can easily refund orders on Polar - both in full or in parts.

No matter what refund policy you offer to customers, Polar makes it easy to offer both full and partial refunds to easily deliver the customer experience and refund policy you want.

However, even in case you have a “no refund” policy, Polar reserves the right to issue refunds within 60 days of purchase - at our own discretion. We reserve this right in an effort to automatically and proactively reduce costly chargebacks.

<Note>
  **Polar can issue refunds on your behalf**

  Polar reserves the right to issue refunds within 60 days of purchase, at its own discretion, in order to prevent chargebacks. So if you choose to have a “no refunds” policy, be aware that Polar could still issue refunds in an effort to proactively prevent chargebacks.
</Note>

## Issuing a refund

1. Go to the order details page for the specific order you want to refund
2. Scroll down to the “Refund” section

**Amount**

Specify the amount to refund. By default it’s the full order amount, but you can reduce this to issue a partial refund instead.

<Warning>
  **Payment fees are not refunded**

  Unfortunately, credit card networks and PSPs charge us for the underlying transactions regardless of whether it’s later refunded (industry standard). Therefore, we cannot offer a refund on our fees since the costs remain constant.

  Example: An order of $30 costs ~$1.6 in fees to Polar. You can still refund the customer $30, but the ~$1.6 fee remains and is deducted on your balance from other purchases.
</Warning>

**Reason**

Select the reason for the refund - helpful for future reference.

**Revoke Benefits (One-time purchases)**

For one-time purchases, you can revoke the customers access to product benefits, e.g file downloads, license keys or Discord/GitHub invites. By default this is selected since we default to a full refund, but can be disabled.

**Revoke Benefits (Subscriptions)**

You cannot revoke access by refunding an order associated with a subscription. Instead the subscription is required to be canceled and Polar will then automatically revoke access once the subscription itself is revoked.


# Seat-Based Pricing
Source: https://polar.sh/docs/features/seat-based-pricing

Sell team products with assignable seats and tiered pricing

Seat-based pricing allows you to sell products where a billing manager purchases a specific number of seats and can assign them to team members. Each seat holder gets their own access to the product benefits, making it perfect for team subscriptions, perpetual licenses, and multi-user products.

<Info>
  **Seat-based pricing is ideal for:**

  * Team subscriptions where one billing manager pays for multiple users
  * Perpetual team licenses with one-time payment
  * Organizational licenses with per-seat pricing
  * Products with volume-based tiering (e.g., \$10/seat for 1-4 seats, \$9/seat for 5+)
</Info>

## Feature Flag

<Warning>
  Seat-based pricing is currently in **private beta**. We are enabling this feature gradually.
</Warning>

Seat-based pricing is controlled by a feature flag at the organization level. Once enabled by our team, you'll have full access to create and manage seat-based products.

## How it works

With seat-based pricing, a billing manager purchases a product (subscription or one-time) with a specific number of seats. They can then:

1. **Assign seats** to team members via email or external customer ID
2. **Manage seats** by resending invitations or revoking access
3. **Scale up** by purchasing additional seats (or a new order for one-time products)
4. **Track usage** by viewing which seats are claimed, pending, or available

Team members receive an invitation email with a claim link. Once they claim their seat, benefits are automatically granted.

### Subscriptions vs One-Time Purchases

Seat-based pricing works for both recurring subscriptions and one-time purchases:

| Feature           | Subscriptions              | One-Time Purchases       |
| ----------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| **Payment**       | Recurring (monthly/yearly) | Single payment           |
| **Seat Duration** | Active while subscribed    | Perpetual (never expire) |
| **Adding Seats**  | Modify subscription        | Purchase new order       |
| **Billing**       | Renews automatically       | No renewals              |
| **Benefits**      | While subscription active  | Forever after claim      |

<Tip>
  Use **subscriptions** for ongoing team access. Use **one-time purchases** for perpetual team licenses.
</Tip>

## Creating a seat-based product

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a new product">
    From your dashboard, navigate to Products and click **Create Product**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure basic settings">
    Set your product name, description, and media as usual.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select seat-based pricing">
    Under **Pricing**, select:

    * **Product type**: Subscription or One-time
    * **Billing cycle** (subscriptions only): Monthly or Yearly
    * **Pricing type**: Seat-based
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure seat tiers">
    Define your pricing tiers based on seat quantity:

    * **Min seats**: Minimum number of seats required to purchase
    * **Tiers**: For each tier, set:
      * **Max seats**: Upper limit for this tier (leave empty for unlimited)
      * **Price per seat**: Amount charged per seat in this tier (in cents)

    Example tiered pricing:

    * 1-4 seats: \$10/seat per month
    * 5-9 seats: \$9/seat per month
    * 10+ seats: \$8/seat per month
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add benefits">
    Configure the benefits that seat holders will receive. These are only granted when a seat is claimed, not when purchased.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
  Unlike standard subscriptions, seat-based products **do not grant benefits to the billing manager**. Benefits are only granted to team members who claim their assigned seats.
</Info>

## Purchasing seats

When a customer purchases a seat-based product, they specify how many seats they want during checkout. The total amount is calculated based on your tiered pricing.

The checkout experience clearly shows:

* Number of seats being purchased
* Price per seat based on volume
* Total amount
* For subscriptions: recurring billing cycle
* For one-time: perpetual access indication

Once payment is completed, the billing manager can immediately start assigning seats to their team.

<Info>
  For **one-time purchases**, each order is independent. If customers want more seats later, they purchase a new order with its own seat pool. All purchased seats remain perpetual.
</Info>

## Managing seats

### Assigning seats

Billing managers can assign seats through:

1. **Customer Portal**: Accessible via the customer portal with billing manager permissions
2. **API**: Programmatically assign seats using the [Customer Seats API](/api-reference/customer-seats/assign)

To assign a seat, provide:

* **Subscription ID** (for subscriptions) or **Order ID** (for one-time purchases)
* **Email address** (creates a new customer if needed)
* **External customer ID** (optional, for syncing with your system)
* **Customer ID** (if customer already exists in Polar)
* **Metadata** (optional, up to 10 keys for custom data like role, department)

An invitation email is automatically sent to the recipient with a secure claim link (valid for 24 hours).

### Seat statuses

Each seat can have one of three statuses:

* **Pending**: Seat assigned, invitation sent, awaiting claim
* **Claimed**: Seat claimed by team member, benefits granted
* **Revoked**: Seat revoked, benefits removed, can be reassigned

### Resending invitations

For pending seats, billing managers can resend the invitation email if it was lost or expired.

### Revoking seats

Billing managers can revoke a claimed seat at any time:

1. Benefits are immediately removed from the seat holder
2. The seat becomes available for reassignment
3. The seat holder loses access to all product benefits
4. The revoked seat can be assigned to a different team member

<Warning>
  Revoking a seat does **not** issue a refund. The billing manager continues to pay for the total number of seats in their subscription.
</Warning>

## Claiming seats

When a team member receives a seat invitation:

1. They click the claim link in the email
2. A claim page displays the product details and organization info
3. They click **Claim Seat** to accept
4. Benefits are automatically granted
5. They receive a customer session token for immediate portal access
6. They can access their benefits through the customer portal

<Info>
  Claim links are single-use and expire after 24 hours for security. If expired, the billing manager can resend the invitation.

## Scaling seats

### Adding seats

**For subscriptions:**

Billing managers can upgrade their subscription to add more seats:

1. The new seat count is applied immediately
2. Prorated charges are calculated for the current billing period
3. Future renewals bill at the new seat count
4. New seats can be assigned right away

If adding seats moves to a different pricing tier, the new per-seat rate applies to **all seats**, not just the additional ones.

**For one-time purchases:**

Billing managers purchase a new order with additional seats:

1. Create a new checkout for the same product with desired seat quantity
2. Once paid, a new independent order is created
3. Each order has its own seat pool
4. All seats remain perpetual across all orders

### Reducing seats

**For subscriptions:**

To reduce seats, the billing manager should:

1. Revoke seats until the desired count is reached
2. Update the subscription to reflect the lower seat count
3. The change takes effect at the next renewal

<Warning>
  You cannot reduce subscription seats below the number of currently claimed seats. Revoke seats first before reducing the subscription seat count.
</Warning>

**For one-time purchases:**

Seats cannot be reduced or refunded as they are perpetual. The billing manager can:

1. Revoke unwanted seats to make them unassigned
2. The seats remain available for future assignment
3. No refund is issued for revoked seats

## API Integration

Seat-based pricing provides full API support for:

* Creating seat-based products with tiered pricing
* Checking out with seat quantities
* Assigning seats programmatically
* Listing seats and their statuses
* Revoking seats

<Note>
  **SDK Version Requirement**

  To use seat-based pricing features, ensure you have the latest version of the Polar SDK installed:

  * TypeScript/JavaScript: `npm install @polar-sh/sdk@latest`
  * Python: `pip install --upgrade polar-sdk`

  Older SDK versions may not include seat-based pricing support.
</Note>

See the [Customer Seats API Reference](/api-reference/customer-seats/assign) for complete documentation.

### Example: Assign a seat (subscription)

```typescript  theme={null}
await polar.customerSeats.assign({
  subscription_id: "sub_123",
  email: "engineer@company.com",
  metadata: {
    department: "Engineering",
    role: "Developer"
  }
});
```

### Example: Assign a seat (one-time purchase)

```typescript  theme={null}
await polar.customerSeats.assign({
  order_id: "order_456",
  email: "engineer@company.com",
  metadata: {
    department: "Engineering",
    role: "Developer"
  }
});
```

### Example: List seats for subscription

```typescript  theme={null}
const seats = await polar.customerSeats.list({
  subscription_id: "sub_123"
});

console.log(`Available: ${seats.available_seats}/${seats.total_seats}`);
```

### Example: List seats for order

```typescript  theme={null}
const seats = await polar.customerSeats.list({
  order_id: "order_456"
});

console.log(`Available: ${seats.available_seats}/${seats.total_seats}`);
```

## Webhooks

Seat-based pricing triggers webhooks for both subscriptions and orders:

**Subscription events:**

* `subscription.created` - When seat-based subscription is purchased
* `subscription.updated` - When seat count changes
* `subscription.canceled` - When subscription is cancelled

**Order events:**

* `order.created` - When seat-based one-time purchase is completed
* `order.updated` - When order is updated

**Seat and benefit events (both types):**

* `benefit_grant.created` - When a seat is claimed and benefits granted
* `benefit_grant.revoked` - When a seat is revoked and benefits removed

<Info>
  For both subscriptions and one-time purchases, `benefit_grant.created` events are triggered per seat claim, not at purchase time.
</Info>

## Best Practices

### Use tiered pricing strategically

Structure your tiers to incentivize volume:

* Lower per-seat prices as quantity increases
* Create tiers at natural team sizes (5, 10, 25, etc.)
* Consider flat pricing for very large teams

### Leverage metadata

Use seat metadata to store:

* Team member roles
* Departments or cost centers

### Monitor seat utilization

Track how many purchased seats are actually claimed to identify:

* Organizations that may need more seats
* Unused capacity that could be reduced
* Patterns in team adoption

### Communicate clearly

Ensure product pages clearly explain:

* The billing manager will not get direct access
* Seats must be assigned to team members
* Pricing structure and volume discounts
* Seat assignment and claiming process

## Limitations

* Seats must be assigned individually (no bulk import via dashboard, use API instead)
* Claim links expire after 24 hours
* Billing manager does not receive product benefits
* Maximum of 1,000 seats per subscription
* Metadata limited to 10 keys and 1KB total size per seat
* **Usage-based pricing with shared emails**: If you sell to multiple businesses and different businesses assign seats to the same email address (e.g., "[john@gmail.com](mailto:john@gmail.com)"), and usage-based pricing is enabled, separate meters should be created for each business to properly segregate usage. This is a rare scenario since employees from different businesses typically don't share the same email address.


# Trials
Source: https://polar.sh/docs/features/trials

Offer free trials on your subscriptions

Trials are a great way to let potential customers experience your product before committing to a subscription. With Polar, you can easily set up free trials for your subscription products.

## Setting up a trial

You can set up a trial period through the following means:

* When creating or editing a [product](/features/products).
* When creating or editing a [checkout link](/features/checkout/links).
* When creating a Checkout Session through the [API](/api-reference/checkouts/create-session).

If you set a trial period on the Checkout Link or Checkout Session, it will **override the trial period set on the product**.

The trial period consists of two parameters:

* **A unit**: day, week, month, or year.
* **A duration**: a number representing how many units the trial will last.

## Starting a trial

When a customer checks out a subscription product with a trial period, they will not be charged immediately. Instead, they will have access to the product for the duration of the trial period.

We'll still collect their payment information at checkout, but they won't be charged until the trial period ends. This means that if they decide to cancel before the trial ends, they won't be charged at all.

Once the trial period ends, the customer will be automatically charged for the subscription, and their billing cycle will begin.

## Adding, extending or canceling a trial

For existing subscriptions, you can add, extend or cancel a customer's trial period at any time through the dashboard, from the subscription details page. Click on **Update Subscription**, then click on the **Trial** tab.

To add or extend a trial, set a new trial end date in the future. If the subscription was active, its status will be changed to **trialing**, and the billing will be postponed until the end of the trial.

To cancel a trial, click on the **End trial** button. The subscription will become active immediately, and the customer will be charged immediately for a new billing cycle.

## Preventing trial abuse

To protect your business from customers repeatedly signing up for trials, you can enable the **Prevent trial abuse** feature from your organization's subscription settings.

### How it works

When this feature is enabled, Polar tracks trial redemptions using:

* **Email addresses**: We automatically detect and normalize email aliases (e.g., `user+alias@example.com` is treated as `user@example.com`) to prevent abuse through simple email variations.
* **Payment method fingerprints**: We track the unique fingerprint of payment methods (credit cards) used during checkout to identify returning customers even if they use a different email address.

A customer will be blocked from starting a new trial if they have previously redeemed a trial for any of your products and match either:

* The same unaliased email address, OR
* The same payment method fingerprint

### Enabling the feature

1. Go to your organization's **Settings** page
2. Navigate to the **Subscription** section
3. Toggle on **Prevent trial abuse**

Once enabled, the feature will apply to all future trial checkout attempts across all your products.

### Customer experience

When a customer who has already used a trial attempts to check out again:

1. They will see an error message: "You have already used a trial for this product. Trials can only be used once per customer."
2. The checkout will automatically refresh without the trial period
3. The customer can still complete their purchase and subscribe at the regular price

This approach ensures a smooth experience while protecting your business from trial abuse.


# Billing
Source: https://polar.sh/docs/features/usage-based-billing/billing

How billing works with Usage Based

## Metered Pricing

Metered Pricing is a pricing model where you charge your customers based on the usage of your application.

There are a few different pricing models unique to Usage Based Billing:

* Unit Pricing
* Volume Pricing *(coming soon)*

### Unit Pricing

Unit pricing is a simple pricing model where you charge a fixed amount for each unit of usage.

For example:

| Product Meter       | Price per unit |
| ------------------- | -------------- |
| `prompt-tokens`     | \$0.10         |
| `completion-tokens` | \$0.18         |

This means that every unit of `prompt-tokens` consumed by a customer will be charged at \$0.10 and every unit of `completion-tokens` will be charged at \$0.18.

It's a linear pricing model, where the price per unit is fixed.

### Volume Pricing *(coming soon)*

Volume pricing is a pricing model where you charge a fixed amount for a certain volume of usage. Volume pricing is not yet available, but will be coming soon.

## Invoicing Customers for Usage

Our Usage Based Billing infrastructure is built to work with Subscription products out of the box.

### Add a metered price to your product

To charge your customers for usage, you need to add a metered price to your product. You'll need the select the **Meter** and the **amount per unit**.

Optionally, you can set a **cap**. The customer will be charged the cap amount if they exceed it, regardless of the usage.

### Monthly Invoicing

If a customer has a subscription with a monthly billing period, usage is aggregated monthly and invoiced at the end of the month with the rest of the subscription.

### Yearly Invoicing

If a customer has a subscription with a yearly billing period, usage is aggregated yearly and invoiced at the end of the year with the rest of the subscription.

### Usage Charges and Subscription Cancellation

When a subscription is canceled, it generally remains active until the end of the current billing period (known as the grace period). During this grace period, all accumulated usage-based charges continue to be tracked. A final invoice will be issued at the end of that period to cover the consumed usage, even if the subscription will not be renewed. This ensures no pending usage charges are lost.

<Warning>
  If a [discount](/features/discounts) is applied on the subscription, it'll be
  applied on the **whole invoice**, including metered usage.
</Warning>

## Customer Portal

Customers can view their estimated charges for each meter in the Customer Portal.

# Credits
Source: https://polar.sh/docs/features/usage-based-billing/credits

Crediting customers for Usage Based Billing

Credits is the way to pre-pay for usage in Polar. It allows you to give your customers the ability to pre-pay for usage instead of risk getting a hefty bill at the end of the month.

## How Credits Work

When you ingest events into a Usage Meter, customers will be charged for the usage based on the product's pricing model.

However, sometimes you may want to give your customers the ability to pre-pay for usage instead of risk getting a hefty bill at the end of the month.

When you issue Credits to a customer, we first deduct the Credits from their Usage Meter balance. If the Usage Meter balance reaches 0, the customer will be charged for the overage.

### Credits-only spending

To avoid any overage charges, don't create any Metered price on your product. This way, billing won't be triggered at all for the meter

## Issuing Credits with the Credits Benefit

The Credits benefit will credit a customer's Usage Meter balance at different points in time depending on the type of product the benefit is attached to.

### Subscription Products

The customer will be credited the amount of units specified in the benefit at the beginning of every subscription cycle period — monthly or yearly.

### One-Time Products

The customer will be credited the amount of units specified in the benefit once at the time of purchase.

## Tracking customer's balance

In your application, you'll likely need to track the customer's balance for a given meter. The easiest way to do this is to use the [Customer State](/integrate/customer-state), which will give you the overview of the customer, including the balance for each of their active meters.

You can also specifically query the meters balance using the [Customer Meters API](/api-reference/customer-meters/list).

<Warning>
  Polar doesn't block usage if the customer exceeds their balance. You're
  responsible for implementing the logic you need to prevent usage if they
  exceed it.
</Warning>


# Event Ingestion
Source: https://polar.sh/docs/features/usage-based-billing/event-ingestion

Ingest events from your application

Events are the core of Usage Based Billing. They represent *some* usage done by a customer in your application. Typical examples of events are:

* A customer consumed AI LLM tokens
* A customer streamed minutes of video
* A customer uploaded a file to your application

Events are sent to Polar using the [Events Ingestion API](/api-reference/events/ingest) and are stored in our database. An event consists of the following fields:

* A `name`, which is a string that can be used to identify the type of event. For example, `ai_usage`, `video_streamed` or `file_uploaded`.
* A `customer_id` or `external_customer_id`, which is Polar's customer ID or your user's ID. This is used to identify the customer that triggered the event.
* A `metadata` object, which is a JSON object that can contain any additional information about the event. This is useful for storing information that can be used to filter the events or compute the actual usage. For example, you can store the duration of the video streamed or the size of the file uploaded.

Here is an example of an event:

```json  theme={null}
{
  "name": "ai_usage",
  "external_customer_id": "cus_123",
  "metadata": {
    "model": "gpt-4.1-nano",
    "requests": 1,
    "total_tokens": 77,
    "request_tokens": 58,
    "response_tokens": 19
  }
}
```

## Ingest events using the Polar SDK

To ingest events, you can use the Polar SDKs.

### TypeScript Example

```typescript  theme={null}
import { Polar } from "@polar-sh/sdk";

const polar = new Polar({
  accessToken: process.env["POLAR_ACCESS_TOKEN"] ?? "",
});

await polar.events.ingest({
  events: [
    {
      name: "<value>",
      externalCustomerId: "<id>",
      metadata: {
        key: "value",
      },
    },
  ],
});
```

<Note>
  You are always responsible for checking the balance of your customers' Usage
  Meter. As events always are ingested, we will never prohibit any customer's
  action based on their Usage Meter balance.
</Note>

## Ingestion Strategies

To make it easier to ingest events, we have created a set of ingestion strategies for common event sources.

Learn more about our [Ingestion Strategies](/features/usage-based-billing/ingestion-strategies).

## Good to know

### Events are immutable

Once an event is ingested, it cannot be changed, nor can it be deleted.

# LLM Strategy
Source: https://polar.sh/docs/features/usage-based-billing/ingestion-strategies/llm-strategy

Ingestion strategy for LLM Usage

## Javascript SDK

### LLM Strategy

Wrap any LLM model from the `@ai-sdk/*` library, to automatically fire prompt- & completion tokens used by every model call.

```
pnpm add @polar-sh/ingestion ai @ai-sdk/openai
```

```typescript  theme={null}
import { Ingestion } from "@polar-sh/ingestion";
import { LLMStrategy } from "@polar-sh/ingestion/strategies/LLM";
import { generateText } from "ai";
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";

// Setup the LLM Ingestion Strategy
const llmIngestion = Ingestion({ accessToken: process.env.POLAR_ACCESS_TOKEN })
  .strategy(new LLMStrategy(openai("gpt-4o")))
  .cost((ctx) => ({ amount: 123, currency: "usd" })) // Optional: Set the cost of the LLM usage
  .ingest("openai-usage");

export async function POST(req: Request) {
  const { prompt }: { prompt: string } = await req.json();

  // Get the wrapped LLM model with ingestion capabilities
  // Pass Customer Id to properly annotate the ingestion events with a specific customer
  const model = llmIngestion.client({
    customerId: "xxx",
  });

  const { text } = await generateText({
    model,
    system: "You are a helpful assistant.",
    prompt,
  });

  return Response.json({ text });
}
```

#### Ingestion Payload

```json  theme={null}
{
  "customerId": "123",
  "name": "openai-usage",
  "metadata": {
    "inputTokens": 100,
    "outputTokens": 200,
    "cachedInputTokens": 10,
    "totalTokens": 300,
    "model": "gpt-4o",
    "provider": "openai.responses",
    "strategy": "LLM",
    "_cost": {
      "amount": 123, // Amount is expected to be in cents. $1.23 should be represented as 123
      "currency": "usd"
    },
    "_llm": {
      ... //
    }
  }
}
```

## Python SDK

Our Python SDK includes an ingestion helper and strategies for common use cases. It's installed as part of the Polar SDK.

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash pip theme={null}
  pip install polar-sdk
  ```

  ```bash uv theme={null}
  uv add polar-sdk
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Ingestion helper

The ingestion helper is a simple wrapper around the Polar events ingestion API. It takes care of batching and sending events to Polar in the background, without blocking your main thread.

```python  theme={null}
import os
from polar_sdk.ingestion import Ingestion

ingestion = Ingestion(os.getenv("POLAR_ACCESS_TOKEN"))

ingestion.ingest({
    "name": "my-event",
    "external_customer_id": "CUSTOMER_ID",
    "metadata": {
        "usage": 13.37,
    }
})
```

### PydanticAI Strategy

[PydanticAI](https://ai.pydantic.dev) is an AI agent framework for Python. A common use-case with AI applications is to track the usage of LLMs, like the number of input and output tokens, and bill the customer accordingly.

With our PydanticAI strategy, you can easily track the usage of LLMs and send the data to Polar for billing.

```python  theme={null}
import os
from polar_sdk.ingestion import Ingestion
from polar_sdk.ingestion.strategies import PydanticAIStrategy
from pydantic import BaseModel
from pydantic_ai import Agent


ingestion = Ingestion(os.getenv("POLAR_ACCESS_TOKEN"))
strategy = ingestion.strategy(PydanticAIStrategy, "ai_usage")


class MyModel(BaseModel):
    city: str
    country: str

# Introduction

Usage based billing using ingested events

<Info>
  Usage Based Billing is a new feature. We have a lot in store and welcome
  feedback!
</Info>

## Overview

Polar has a powerful Usage Based Billing infrastructure that allows you to charge your customers based on the usage of your application.

This is done by ingesting events from your application, creating Meters to represent that usage, and then adding metered prices to Products to charge for it.

## Concepts

### Events

Events are the core of Usage Based Billing. They represent *some* usage done by a customer in your application. Typical examples of events are:

* A customer consumed AI LLM tokens
* A customer streamed minutes of video
* A customer uploaded a file to your application

Events are sent to Polar using the [Events Ingestion API](/api-reference/events/ingest) and are stored in our database. An event consists of the following fields:

* A `name`, which is a string that can be used to identify the type of event. For example, `ai_usage`, `video_streamed` or `file_uploaded`.
* A `customer_id` or `external_customer_id`, which is Polar's customer ID or your user's ID. This is used to identify the customer that triggered the event.
* A `metadata` object, which is a JSON object that can contain any additional information about the event. This is useful for storing information that can be used to filter the events or compute the actual usage. For example, you can store the duration of the video streamed or the size of the file uploaded.

Here is an example of an event:

```json  theme={null}
{
  "name": "ai_usage",
  "external_customer_id": "cus_123",
  "metadata": {
    "model": "gpt-4.1-nano",
    "requests": 1,
    "total_tokens": 77,
    "request_tokens": 58,
    "response_tokens": 19
  }
}
```

### Meters

Meters are there to filter and aggregate the events that are ingested. Said another way, this is how you define what usage you want to charge for, based on the events you send to Polar. For example:

* AI usage meter, which filters the events with the name `ai_usage` and sums the `total_tokens` field.
* Video streaming meter, which filters the events with the name `video_streamed` and sums the `duration` field.
* File upload meter, which filters the events with the name `file_uploaded` and sums the `size` field.

You can create and manage your meters from the dashboard. Polar is then able to compute the usage over time, both globally and per customer.

### Metered Price

A metered price is a price that is based on the usage of a meter, which is computed by filtering aggregating the events that are ingested. This is how you charge your customers for the usage of your application.

### Meter Credits benefit

You can give credits to your customers on a specific meter. This is done by creating a Meter Credits Benefit, which is a special type of benefit that allows you to give credits to your customers on a specific meter.

On a recurring product, the customer will be credited the amount of units specified in the benefit at the beginning of every subscription cycle period — monthly or yearly.

## Quickstart

Get up and running in 5 minutes

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Meter">
    Meters consist of filters and an aggregation function.
    The filter is used to filter the events that should be included in the meter and the aggregation function is used to compute the usage.

# Meters

Creating and managing meters for Usage Based Billing

Meters are there to filter and aggregate the events that are ingested. Said another way, this is how you define what usage you want to charge for, based on the events you send to Polar. For example:

* AI usage meter, which filters the events with the name `ai_usage` and sums the `total_tokens` field.
* Video streaming meter, which filters the events with the name `video_streamed` and sums the `duration` field.
* File upload meter, which filters the events with the name `file_uploaded` and sums the `size` field.

You can create and manage your meters from the dashboard. Polar is then able to compute the usage over time, both globally and per customer.

## Creating a Meter

To create a meter, navigate to the Meters page in the sidebar and click the "Create Meter" button.

## Filters

A filter is a set of clauses that are combined using conjunctions. They're used to filter events that you've ingested into Polar.

### Clauses

A clause is a condition that an event must meet to be included in the meter.

#### Property

Properties are the properties of the event that you want to filter on.

If you want to match on a metadata field, you can use the metadata key directly. No need to include a `metadata.` prefix.

#### Operator

Operators are the operators that you want to use to filter the events.

* **Equals**
* **Not equals**
* **Greater Than**
* **Greater Than or Equals**
* **Less Than**
* **Less Than or Equals**
* **Contains**
* **Does Not Contain**

#### Value

Values are automatically parsed in the filter builder. They're parsed in the following order:

1. Number — Tries to parse the value as number
2. Boolean — Checks if value is "true" or "false"
3. String — Treats value as string as fallback

### Conjunctions

A conjunction is a logical operator that combines two or more clauses.

* **and** — All clauses must be true for the event to be included.
* **or** — At least one clause must be true for the event to be included.

## Aggregation

The aggregation is the function that is used to aggregate the events that match the filter.

For example, if you want to count the number of events that match the filter, you can use the **Count** aggregation. If you want to sum the value of a metadata field, you can use the **Sum** aggregation.

* **Count** — Counts the number of events that match the filter.
* **Sum** — Sums the value of a property.
* **Average** — Computes the average value of a property.
* **Minimum** — Computes the minimum value of a property.
* **Maximum** — Computes the maximum value of a property.
* **Unique** — Counts the number of unique values of a property.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Example">
    Consider the following events:

    ```json  theme={null}
    [
      {
        "name": "ai_usage",
        "external_customer_id": "cus_123",
        "metadata": {
          "total_tokens": 10
        }
      },
      {
        "name": "ai_usage",
        "external_customer_id": "cus_123",
        "metadata": {
          "total_tokens": 20
        }
      },
      {
        "name": "ai_usage",
        "external_customer_id": "cus_123",
        "metadata": {
          "total_tokens": 30
        }
      },
      {
        "name": "ai_usage",
        "external_customer_id": "cus_123",
        "metadata": {
          "total_tokens": 30
        }
      }
    ]
    ```

    Here is the result of each aggregation function, over the `total_tokens` metadata property:

    * **Count**: 4 units
    * **Sum**: 90 units
    * **Average**: 22.5 units
    * **Minimum**: 10 units
    * **Maximum**: 30 units
    * **Unique**: 3 units
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

If you want to use a metadata property in the aggregation, you can use the metadata property directly. No need to include a `metadata.` prefix.

## Example

The following Meter Filter & Aggregation will match events that have the name `openai-usage` and sum units over metadata property `completionTokens`.

## Good to know

A few things to keep in mind when creating and managing meters:

### Renaming a Meter

Until [https://github.com/polarsource/polar/issues/6490](https://github.com/polarsource/polar/issues/6490) is fixed, please [contact support](/support) to rename the meter for you.

### Updating a Meter

You may update a meter's filters or aggregation function as long as the meter doesn't have any processed events or does not have any customer purchase associated with it.

Learn how to use the Custom Benefit to automatically share links with customers after purchase.

## Create a Custom Benefit

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Benefits">
    In the Polar dashboard sidebar, click on **Benefits**.

    You can also go directly to `https://polar.sh/dashboard/${org_slug}/products/benefits`.

    <img height="200" src="https://mintcdn.com/polar/rKs2Fff6lka61O-Y/assets/guides/automate-post-purchase-link-sharing/benefits-page.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=rKs2Fff6lka61O-Y&q=85&s=70fa50c0ac36ad18b5199025e96d47c0" data-og-width="1753" data-og-height="895" data-path="assets/guides/automate-post-purchase-link-sharing/benefits-page.png" data-optimize="true" data-opv="3" srcset="https://mintcdn.com/polar/rKs2Fff6lka61O-Y/assets/guides/automate-post-purchase-link-sharing/benefits-page.png?w=280&fit=max&auto=format&n=rKs2Fff6lka61O-Y&q=85&s=9f717248844b61b4347678adb69f8657 280w, https://mintcdn.com/polar/rKs2Fff6lka61O-Y/assets/guides/automate-post-purchase-link-sharing/benefits-page.png?w=560&fit=max&auto=format&n=rKs2Fff6lka61O-Y&q=85&s=5171950de488357cb3b38122fb008276 560w, https://mintcdn.com/polar/rKs2Fff6lka61O-Y/assets/guides/automate-post-purchase-link-sharing/benefits-page.png?w=840&fit=max&auto=format&n=rKs2Fff6lka61O-Y&q=85&s=e1d3afe3cff8bf002e577a4e58986378 840w, https://mintcdn.com/polar/rKs2Fff6lka61O-Y/assets/guides/automate-post-purchase-link-sharing/benefits-page.png?w=1100&fit=max&auto=format&n=rKs2Fff6lka61O-Y&q=85&s=f1be4c81a66d425ea6a12bcf6b20410a 1100w, https://mintcdn.com/polar/rKs2Fff6lka61O-Y/assets/guides/automate-post-purchase-link-sharing/benefits-page.png?w=1650&fit=max&auto=format&n=rKs2Fff6lka61O-Y&q=85&s=3cdb04a1f9025903f47e41040272eda8 1650w, https://mintcdn.com/polar/rKs2Fff6lka61O-Y/assets/guides/automate-post-purchase-link-sharing/benefits-page.png?w=2500&fit=max&auto=format&n=rKs2Fff6lka61O-Y&q=85&s=556dbf78588e017661df839a3209cb55 2500w" />
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click on Create Benefit">
    Click on **Create Benefit**. You’ll see three configuration fields as shown in the image below: **Description**, **Type**, and **Private note**.

    <img height="200" src="https://mintcdn.com/polar/rKs2Fff6lka61O-Y/assets/guides/automate-post-purchase-link-sharing/create-benefit.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=rKs2Fff6lka61O-Y&q=85&s=0bb5a2fdbf2266e9ce9891238a3eb090" data-og-width="1753" data-og-height="895" data-path="assets/guides/automate-post-purchase-link-sharing/create-benefit.png" data-optimize="true" data-opv="3" srcset="https://mintcdn.com/polar/rKs2Fff6lka61O-Y/assets/guides/automate-post-purchase-link-sharing/create-benefit.png?w=280&fit=max&auto=format&n=rKs2Fff6lka61O-Y&q=85&s=c610378a483683f66c47bd4094ab17ad 280w, https://mintcdn.com/polar/rKs2Fff6lka61O-Y/assets/guides/automate-post-purchase-link-sharing/create-benefit.png?w=560&fit=max&auto=format&n=rKs2Fff6lka61O-Y&q=85&s=dcc2514407ed6b0c27ad8f599231ed29 560w, https://mintcdn.com/polar/rKs2Fff6lka61O-Y/assets/guides/automate-post-purchase-link-sharing/create-benefit.png?w=840&fit=max&auto=format&n=rKs2Fff6lka61O-Y&q=85&s=7663be86fd6cab13bef5f587e4e58ce8 840w, https://mintcdn.com/polar/rKs2Fff6lka61O-Y/assets/guides/automate-post-purchase-link-sharing/create-benefit.png?w=1100&fit=max&auto=format&n=rKs2Fff6lka61O-Y&q=85&s=ccacf4cd09e2fd2f6e49be3d11fe1f85 1100w, https://mintcdn.com/polar/rKs2Fff6lka61O-Y/assets/guides/automate-post-purchase-link-sharing/create-benefit.png?w=1650&fit=max&auto=format&n=rKs2Fff6lka61O-Y&q=85&s=7a7db7f2d4d80cd30ee9839da8aee995 1650w, https://mintcdn.com/polar/rKs2Fff6lka61O-Y/assets/guides/automate-post-purchase-link-sharing/create-benefit.png?w=2500&fit=max&auto=format&n=rKs2Fff6lka61O-Y&q=85&s=9663e3db69beb8b1a38841c51a52352d 2500w" />

    The **Type** field is set to Custom by default (which is what we need).

    <Note>
      The **Private note** field is specific to the Custom **Type**.  If you select a different **Type**, you’ll see configuration options specific to that type instead.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Fill the configuration fields">
    <a id="configuration-fill" />

    Fill the **Description** and **Private note** fields where:

    * **Description** accepts regular text and is the title of the link that you want to share with the customer.
    * **Private note** uses the [Markdown format](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) so you can format text, add links, or lists.

    Make sure to add your link inside the **Private note** section so that it's only accessible post a payment.
    Then, click the **Create** button to save the configuration.

  <Step title="Create a Checkout Session using the API">
    Open your terminal and paste the following curl command to make an API call for creating a checkout session.
    Be sure to replace:

    * \<YOUR\_ACCESS\_TOKEN> with your actual access token
    * \<PRODUCT\_ID\_1>, \<PRODUCT\_ID\_2>, etc., with the product IDs you want to include in the session

    ```bash Terminal theme={null}
    curl --request POST \
        --url https://api.polar.sh/v1/checkouts/ \
        --header 'Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN>' \
        --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
        --data '{
        "products": [
            "<Product_ID_1>",
            "<Product_ID_2>",
            "<Product_ID_3>"
        ]
    }'
    ```

    Find the description of all the parameters in the [Create Checkout Session API](https://polar.sh/docs/api-reference/checkouts/create-session).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Access the Checkout Session URL">
    The curl command returns a JSON. Access the checkout URL from the <code>"url"</code> key of the JSON.

    ```json  theme={null}
    {
        "...": "...",
        "url": "https://buy.polar.sh/polar_c_...", // [!code ++]

## Reordering Products In Checkout Links API

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Checkout Link using the API">
    Open your terminal and paste the following curl command to make an API call for creating a checkout link.
    Be sure to replace:

    * \<YOUR\_ACCESS\_TOKEN> with your actual access token.

    <Note>
      Make sure your token has the **`checkout_links:write`** scope enabled to use [Create Checkout Link API](/api-reference/checkout-links/create).
    </Note>

    * \<PRODUCT\_ID\_1>, \<PRODUCT\_ID\_2>, etc., with the product IDs in the order you want them to appear in the checkout.

    ```bash Terminal theme={null}
    curl --request POST \
        --url https://api.polar.sh/v1/checkout-links/ \
        --header 'Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN>' \
        --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
        --data '{
        "products": [
            "<Product_ID_1>",
            "<Product_ID_2>"
        ]
    }'
    ```

    Find all the available parameters along with the description in the  [Create Checkout Link API](https://polar.sh/docs/api-reference/checkout-links/create).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Open the Checkout Link URL">
    The curl command returns a JSON. Access the checkout link URL from the <code>"url"</code> key of the JSON and open it.

    ```json  theme={null}
    {
        "...": "...",
        "...": "...",
        "url": "https://buy.polar.sh/polar_cl_..." // [!code ++]

  </Step>

  <Step title="Change the order of products">
    If you want to change the order and make Product 2 appear before Product 1, place Product 2's ID first, followed by Product 1's ID in the API call.

    ```bash Terminal theme={null}
    curl --request POST \

# How to disable email editing in checkout
Source: https://polar.sh/docs/guides/disable-email-editing-in-checkout

Learn how to prevent customers from editing their email address during checkout by linking to existing customers.

When you want to prevent customers from changing their email address during the checkout process, you can link the checkout session to an existing customer. This is useful when customers are already authenticated in your application and you want to ensure the purchase is associated with their verified account.

## Overview

By passing either `customer_id` or `external_customer_id` when creating a checkout session, Polar will:

* Pre-fill the customer's information in the checkout form
* **Disable the email field** so it cannot be edited
* Link the resulting order to the specified customer

## Using Customer ID

If you've already created a customer in Polar and have their Polar customer ID, you can use it directly.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get the Customer ID">
    Retrieve the customer ID from your Polar dashboard or through the [Customers API](/api-reference/customers/list).

    The customer ID is a UUID format like: `992fae2a-2a17-4b7a-8d9e-e287cf90131b`
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create Checkout Session with customer_id">
    Pass the `customer_id` parameter when creating the checkout session.

    <CodeGroup>
      ```ts TypeScript theme={null}
      import { Polar } from "@polar-sh/sdk";

      const polar = new Polar({ accessToken: process.env["POLAR_ACCESS_TOKEN"] });

      const checkout = await polar.checkouts.create({
          products: ["<product_id>"],
          customerId: "992fae2a-2a17-4b7a-8d9e-e287cf90131b", // [!code ++]
      });

      console.log(checkout.url);
      ```

      ```py Python theme={null}
      from polar_sdk import Polar

      with Polar(
          access_token="<YOUR_BEARER_TOKEN_HERE>",
      ) as polar:

          checkout = polar.checkouts.create(request={
              "products": ["<product_id>"],
              "customer_id": "992fae2a-2a17-4b7a-8d9e-e287cf90131b",  # [!code ++]
          })

          print(checkout.url)
      ```

      ```bash cURL theme={null}
      curl --request POST \
        --url https://api.polar.sh/v1/checkouts/ \
        --header 'Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN>' \
        --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
        --data '{
          "products": ["<product_id>"],
          "customer_id": "992fae2a-2a17-4b7a-8d9e-e287cf90131b"
        }'
      ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Redirect to Checkout">
    Redirect your customer to the checkout URL returned in the response. The email field will be pre-filled and disabled for editing.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Using External Customer ID

If you have your own user management system, you can use your internal customer ID. This is the recommended approach as it makes reconciliation between your system and Polar easier.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Use Your Internal Customer ID">
    When creating a checkout session, pass your application's user ID as the `external_customer_id`.

    Polar will:

    * Look for an existing customer with this external ID
    * If found, link to that customer and pre-fill their data
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create Checkout Session with external_customer_id">
    <CodeGroup>
      ```ts TypeScript theme={null}
      import { Polar } from "@polar-sh/sdk";

      const polar = new Polar({ accessToken: process.env["POLAR_ACCESS_TOKEN"] });

      const checkout = await polar.checkouts.create({
          products: ["<product_id>"],
          externalCustomerId: "user_12345", // Your application's user ID // [!code ++]
      });

      console.log(checkout.url);
      ```

      ```py Python theme={null}
      from polar_sdk import Polar

      with Polar(
          access_token="<YOUR_BEARER_TOKEN_HERE>",
      ) as polar:

          checkout = polar.checkouts.create(request={
              "products": ["<product_id>"],
              "external_customer_id": "user_12345",  # Your application's user ID # [!code ++]
          })

          print(checkout.url)
      ```

      ```bash cURL theme={null}
      curl --request POST \
        --url https://api.polar.sh/v1/checkouts/ \
        --header 'Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN>' \
        --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
        --data '{
          "products": ["<product_id>"],
          "external_customer_id": "user_12345"
        }'
      ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Redirect to Checkout">
    Redirect your customer to the checkout URL. The email field will be disabled from editing.
  </Step>

# How to Grant Meter Credits After Purchase
Source: https://polar.sh/docs/guides/grant-meter-credits-after-purchase

Learn how to automatically grant meter credits to users after purchase using the Meter Credits benefits or Webhooks.

## Overview

When building usage-based billing systems, you may want to give new customers an initial credit balance (e.g., 10 free units) when they purchase a product. This is useful for:

* Offering free trials with credits
* Onboarding bonuses
* Promotional credits for new signups or purchases

There are two ways to grant initial meter credits in Polar:

1. **Meter Credits Benefit (Recommended)** - Automatically grant credits when a customer purchases a product
2. **Webhook + Events API** - Programmatically grant credits for advanced use cases

### Which Method Should I Use?

| Feature                | Meter Credits Benefit         | Webhook + Events API                      |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Setup Complexity**   | ✅ Simple - No code required   | ⚙️ Advanced - Requires coding             |
| **Automatic Credits**  | ✅ Yes                         | ❌ No - Manual implementation              |
| **Custom Logic**       | ❌ No                          | ✅ Yes - Full control                      |
| **One-time Products**  | ✅ Credits granted at purchase | ✅ Credits granted at purchase             |
| **Recurring Products** | ❌ No                          | ✅ Can be credited every cycle (with code) |
| **Best For**           | Most use cases                | Complex crediting rules                   |

<Tip>
  **Start with Method 1** (Meter Credits Benefit) unless you need custom logic or complex crediting rules. It's simpler and requires no code.
</Tip>

***

## Method 1: Using Meter Credits Benefit (Recommended)

The simplest way to grant initial credits is to use the built-in **Meter Credits** benefit. This automatically grants credits (once) to customers when they purchase a product.

### Step 1: Create a Meter with Sum Aggregation

First, [create a meter](/features/usage-based-billing/meters) that will track your customers usage.

### Step 2: Create a Meter Credits Benefit

Now [create a Meter Credits benefit](/features/benefits/credits) that will grant the initial credits.

### Step 3: Create a Product with the Benefit

Create a product and attach the Meter Credits benefit to it.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a product">
    Navigate to **Products** > **Catalogue** and click **New Product**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure the product">
    * Set a name and description
    * Choose your product type (Recurring)
    * Set the price (can be \$0 for free signup, or any amount)
    * Click "Add Additional Price"
      * Attach your meter to the product and set the per unit cost
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add the Meter Credits benefit">
    Scroll to the **Automated Benefits** section and toggle ON the Meter Credits benefit you created.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save the product">
    Click **Create Product** to save.
  </Step>
</Steps>

That's it! Now when a customer purchases this product, they will automatically receive the specified amount of meter credits.

***

## Method 2: Using Webhooks + Events API (Advanced)

For more complex scenarios where you need custom logic or want to grant credits outside the purchase flow, you can use webhooks and the Events API.

### When to Use This Method

* You need custom logic to determine credit amounts
* You want to grant credits based on external events
* You need to grant credits to existing customers programmatically
* You want to implement complex crediting rules

### How It Works

This approach involves:

1. Creating a product with a meter attached (using sum aggregation)
2. Setting up webhooks to listen for purchases
3. When a purchase is made, ingesting a negative event value to grant credits

<Info>
  **Why negative values?**

  When you ingest an event with a negative value (e.g., `-10`) to a meter using **Sum** aggregation, it effectively grants the customer 10 units of credit, reducing their usage meter balance.
</Info>

### Prerequisites

* A Polar account with an organization
* A meter created with **Sum** aggregation
* A product with the meter attached
* Webhooks enabled
* A Polar access token for API calls

### Step 1: Create a Meter

First, create a meter that will track your customers' usage.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Meters">
    In the Polar dashboard sidebar, click on **Products** > **Meters**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a new meter">
    Click **Create Meter** and configure:

    * **Name**: Give your meter a descriptive name (e.g., "API Calls" or "Storage Usage")
    * **Filter**: Add filters to match your usage events (e.g., name equals "api\_usage")
    * **Aggregation**: Select **Sum** and enter the property to sum (e.g., `units`)

    <Warning>
      The meter **must use Sum aggregation** for this approach to work.
    </Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save the meter">
    Save your meter and note down the meter name - you'll need this when ingesting events.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Learn more about [creating meters](/features/usage-based-billing/meters).

### Step 2. Create a Product

Follow the same steps as Method 1 to create your product (you don't need to create or attach the Meter Credits benefit for this approach).

### Step 3: Set Up Webhooks

Configure webhooks to receive notifications when users make purchases.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add webhook endpoint">
    Follow our [Setup Webhooks](/integrate/webhooks/endpoints) guide to create a new webhook endpoint.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Subscribe to order.paid event">
    When configuring your webhook, make sure to subscribe to the `order.paid` event. This event is triggered when a customer successfully completes a purchase.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save webhook secret">
    Store your webhook secret securely in your environment variables.

    ```bash Terminal theme={null}
    POLAR_ACCESS_TOKEN="polar_pat_..."
    POLAR_WEBHOOK_SECRET="whsec_..."
    PRODUCT_ID="prod_..." # The product ID to grant credits for
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Step 4: Implement the Webhook Handler

Create a webhook handler that listens for `order.paid` events and grants initial credits by ingesting negative event values.

#### Next.js Example

```typescript icon="square-js" title="app/api/webhook/polar/route.ts" theme={null}
import { Polar } from "@polar-sh/sdk";
import { Webhooks } from "@polar-sh/nextjs";

const polar = new Polar({ accessToken: process.env.POLAR_ACCESS_TOKEN });

export const POST = Webhooks({
  webhookSecret: process.env.POLAR_WEBHOOK_SECRET,
  onOrderPaid: async (order) => {
    // Check if this is the product we want to grant credits for
    const targetProductId = process.env.PRODUCT_ID;
    if (order.data.product_id === targetProductId) {
      // Grant 10 credits by ingesting a negative event
      await polar.events.ingest({
        events: [
          {
            name: "meter-name",
            customerId: order.data.customer_id,
            metadata: {
              units: -10, // Negative value grants credits
              reason: "initial_signup_bonus",
            },
          },
        ],
      });
      console.log(`Granted 10 credits to customer ${order.data.customer_id}`);
    }
  },
});
```

### Step 5: Test Your Integration

Test that credits are properly granted when a customer makes a purchase.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Use the sandbox environment">
    Test your integration in Polar's [sandbox environment](/integrate/sandbox) to avoid affecting production data.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Make a test purchase">
    Create a checkout session and complete a test purchase.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify webhook receipt">
    Check your server logs to confirm the `order.paid` webhook was received.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Check customer balance">
    Use the [Customer Meters API](/api-reference/customer-meters/list) to verify the credits were applied:

    ```typescript  theme={null}
    const meters = await polar.customerMeters.list({
      customerId: "cus_...",
    });

    console.log(meters.items[0].balance); // Should show -10 (or your credit amount)
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Important Considerations for Webhook Method

#### Negative Balance vs. Positive Usage

When using negative events to grant credits:

* A **negative balance** (e.g., `-10`) means the customer has 10 credits available
* As the customer uses your service, positive events reduce this negative balance
* When the balance reaches `0`, the customer has used all their credits
* Positive balances indicate usage beyond the granted credits

#### Example Flow

```typescript  theme={null}
// Initial state: Customer has 0 balance
// You grant 10 credits: balance = -10

// Customer uses 3 units: balance = -7 (7 credits remaining)
// Customer uses 5 more units: balance = -2 (2 credits remaining)
// Customer uses 3 more units: balance = 1 (1 unit of overage, if metered pricing is enabled)
```

#### Preventing Double Credits

To avoid granting credits multiple times, consider:

1. **Check order status** - Only grant credits for new orders
2. **Use idempotency** - Track which orders you've already processed
3. **Database records** - Store a record of credit grants

```typescript  theme={null}
// Example with idempotency check
const hasGrantedCredits = await checkIfAlreadyGranted(order.id);

if (!hasGrantedCredits) {
  await polar.events.ingest({
    events: [{
      name: "meter-name",
      customerId: order.data.customer_id,
      metadata: { units: -10 },
    }],
  });

  await recordCreditGrant(order.id);
}
```


# How to Grant Meter Credits Before Purchase
Source: https://polar.sh/docs/guides/grant-meter-credits-before-purchase

Learn how to grant meter credits to customers before they make any purchase using the Polar API.

## Overview

You may want to grant usage credits to customers even before they make a purchase. This is useful for:

* **Free trial credits** - Give new signups free credits to try your service
* **Promotional campaigns** - Grant credits as part of marketing initiatives
* **Testing and demos** - Provide credits for product demonstrations

This guide shows you how to grant credits to customers who don't have an active subscription or purchase yet.

## How It Works

To grant credits before a purchase, you need to:

1. Create a customer in Polar (if they don't exist)
2. Create a meter with **Sum** aggregation to track usage
3. Ingest an event with a **negative value** to grant credits

<Info>
  **Why negative values?**

  When you ingest an event with a negative value (e.g., `-10`) to a meter using **Sum** aggregation, it grants the customer credits. A negative balance means available credits, which get reduced as they use your service.
</Info>

## Step 1: Create a Meter

First, create a meter that will track your customers' usage.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Meters">
    In the Polar dashboard sidebar, click on **Products** > **Meters**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a new meter">
    Click **Create Meter** and configure:

    * **Name**: Give your meter a descriptive name (e.g., "API Calls" or "Storage Usage")
    * **Filter**: Add filters to match your usage events (e.g., name equals "api\_usage")
    * **Aggregation**: Select **Sum** and enter the property to sum (e.g., `units`)

    <Warning>
      The meter **must use Sum aggregation** for this approach to work.
    </Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save the meter">
    Save your meter and note down the meter name - you'll need this when ingesting events.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Learn more about [creating meters](/features/usage-based-billing/meters).

## Step 2: Create a Customer

If your customer doesn't already exist in Polar, you need to create them first.

### Option A: Create via Dashboard

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Customers">
    In the Polar dashboard sidebar, click on **Customers**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add new customer">
    Click **Add Customer** and fill in:

    * **Email**: Customer's email address (required)
    * **Name**: Customer's full name (optional)
    * **External ID**: Your internal user ID for easy reference (optional but recommended)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save customer">
    Click **Save** and note down the Customer ID.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Option B: Create via API

Use the Polar SDK or API to create a customer programmatically:

```typescript icon="square-js" title="create-customer.ts" theme={null}
import { Polar } from "@polar-sh/sdk";

const polar = new Polar({
  accessToken: process.env.POLAR_ACCESS_TOKEN,
});

// Create a new customer
await polar.customers.create({
  email: "user@example.com",
  name: "John Doe",
  externalId: "user_123", // Your internal user ID (optional)
});
```

<Tip>
  Use the `externalId` field to link Polar customers with your internal user system. This allows you to reference customers without storing Polar's internal ID.
</Tip>

### Using External ID

If you set an `externalId` when creating the customer, you can use it in event ingestion instead of the Polar customer ID:

```typescript  theme={null}
// Instead of using customerId, use externalCustomerId
await polar.events.ingest({
  events: [{
    name: "api_usage",
    externalCustomerId: "user_123", // Your internal ID
    metadata: { units: -10 }
  }]
});
```

Learn more about [customer management](/features/customer-management).

## Step 3: Grant Credits by Ingesting a Negative Event

Now that you have a customer and a meter, grant credits by ingesting an event with a negative value.

### Using the Polar SDK

```typescript icon="square-js" title="grant-credits.ts" theme={null}
import { Polar } from "@polar-sh/sdk";

const polar = new Polar({
  accessToken: process.env.POLAR_ACCESS_TOKEN,
});

async function grantCredits(customerId: string, credits: number) {
  await polar.events.ingest({
    events: [
      {
        customerId,
        name: "api_usage", // Must match your meter's filter name
        metadata: {
          units: -credits, // Negative value grants credits
        },
      },
    ],
  });

  console.log(`Granted ${credits} credits to customer ${customerId}`);
}

// Grant 10 credits to a customer
await grantCredits("cus_abc123", 10);
```

### Using External Customer ID

If you're using `externalId` for customer management:

```typescript icon="square-js" title="grant-credits-external.ts" theme={null}
import { Polar } from "@polar-sh/sdk";

const polar = new Polar({
  accessToken: process.env.POLAR_ACCESS_TOKEN,
});

async function grantCreditsToExternalUser(externalUserId: string, credits: number) {
  await polar.events.ingest({
    events: [
      {
        name: "api_usage", // Must match your meter's filter name
        externalCustomerId: externalUserId, // Use your internal ID
        metadata: {
          units: -credits, // Negative value grants credits
        },
      },
    ],
  });

  console.log(`Granted ${credits} credits to user ${externalUserId}`);
}

// Grant 10 credits using your internal user ID
await grantCreditsToExternalUser("user_123", 10);
```

## Step 4: Verify Credits Were Granted

Check that the credits were successfully granted to the customer.

### Using Customer Meters API

```typescript  theme={null}
import { Polar } from "@polar-sh/sdk";

const polar = new Polar({
  accessToken: process.env.POLAR_ACCESS_TOKEN,
});

// Check customer's meter balance
const meters = await polar.customerMeters.list({
  customerId: "cus_abc123",
});

meters.items.filter((balance) => balance > 0).forEach((meter) => {
  console.log(`${Math.abs(meter.balance)} credits available for ${meter.meter_id}.`);
});
```

### Example Usage Flow

```typescript  theme={null}
// Initial state: Customer created, 0 balance
// Grant 10 credits: balance = 10

// Customer uses 3 units
await polar.events.ingest({
  events: [{
    name: "api_usage",
    customerId: "cus_abc123",
    metadata: { units: 3 } // Positive value for usage
  }]
});

// Balance is now 7 (7 credits remaining)

// Customer uses 8 more units
await polar.events.ingest({
  events: [{
    name: "api_usage",
    customerId: "cus_abc123",
    metadata: { units: 8 }
  }]
});

// Balance is now -1 (used 1 unit beyond credits)
```

# Integrate Polar with Laravel
Source: https://polar.sh/docs/guides/laravel

In this guide, we'll show you how to integrate Polar with Laravel.

<img src="https://mintcdn.com/polar/0Af3hN6-oIM4IHT3/assets/guides/laravel/hero.jpeg?fit=max&auto=format&n=0Af3hN6-oIM4IHT3&q=85&s=7f57da3dcc77d6f8e0f8b2e760f0aeea" data-og-width="1920" width="1920" data-og-height="1080" height="1080" data-path="assets/guides/laravel/hero.jpeg" data-optimize="true" data-opv="3" srcset="https://mintcdn.com/polar/0Af3hN6-oIM4IHT3/assets/guides/laravel/hero.jpeg?w=280&fit=max&auto=format&n=0Af3hN6-oIM4IHT3&q=85&s=5c8af67a7a1f3e1ed28e24fd633057fb 280w, https://mintcdn.com/polar/0Af3hN6-oIM4IHT3/assets/guides/laravel/hero.jpeg?w=560&fit=max&auto=format&n=0Af3hN6-oIM4IHT3&q=85&s=991feb7c5298a76f861c23fe8143583b 560w, https://mintcdn.com/polar/0Af3hN6-oIM4IHT3/assets/guides/laravel/hero.jpeg?w=840&fit=max&auto=format&n=0Af3hN6-oIM4IHT3&q=85&s=2a542a3866463e546ed8f3d295fcf843 840w, https://mintcdn.com/polar/0Af3hN6-oIM4IHT3/assets/guides/laravel/hero.jpeg?w=1100&fit=max&auto=format&n=0Af3hN6-oIM4IHT3&q=85&s=4f7bc6092412d56d1ae3bccdfeebdfcf 1100w, https://mintcdn.com/polar/0Af3hN6-oIM4IHT3/assets/guides/laravel/hero.jpeg?w=1650&fit=max&auto=format&n=0Af3hN6-oIM4IHT3&q=85&s=9b627520015006b566123b43379d83c0 1650w, https://mintcdn.com/polar/0Af3hN6-oIM4IHT3/assets/guides/laravel/hero.jpeg?w=2500&fit=max&auto=format&n=0Af3hN6-oIM4IHT3&q=85&s=36e5b661f7df187fac6bb1b04d18fa88 2500w" />

Consider following this guide while using the Polar Sandbox Environment. This will allow you to test your integration without affecting your production data.

## Polar Laravel Example App

We've created a simple example Laravel application that you can use as a reference.

[View Code on GitHub](https://github.com/polarsource/polar-laravel)

## Setting up environment variables

### Polar API Key

To authenticate with Polar, you need to create an access token, and supply it to Laravel using a `POLAR_API_KEY` environment variable.

You can create an organization access token from your organization settings.

## Fetching Polar Products for display

### Creating the Products Controller

Go ahead and add the following entry in your `routes/web.php` file:

```php  theme={null}
// routes/web.php
Route::get('/products', [ProductsController::class, 'handle']);
```

Next up, create the `ProductsController` class in the `app/Http/Controllers` directory:

```php  theme={null}
// app/Http/Controllers/ProductsController.php
<?php

namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use Illuminate\Http\Request;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Http;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Log;

class ProductsController extends Controller
{
    public function handle(Request $request)
    {
        // Change from sandbox-api.polar.sh -> api.polar.sh when ready to go live
        // And don't forget to update the .env file with the correct POLAR_ORGANIZATION_ID and POLAR_WEBHOOK_SECRET
        $data = Http::get('https://sandbox-api.polar.sh/v1/products', [
            'is_archived' => false,
        ]);

        $products = $data->json();

        return view('products', ['products' => $products['items']]);
    }
}
```

## Displaying Products

Finally, create the `products` view in the `resources/views` directory:

```php  theme={null}
// resources/views/products.blade.php
@foreach ($products as $product)
    <div>
        <h3>{{ $product['name'] }}</h3>
        <a href="/checkout?priceId={{ $product['prices'][0]['id'] }}">Buy</a>
    </div>
@endforeach
```

Notice that we create a link to `/checkout` with a query parameter `priceId`. This is the ID of the price that the user will be charged for when they click the "Buy" button. We will configure this route in the next section.

That's it for the products page. You can now display the products to your users, and they will be able to buy them. Let's now create the checkout endpoint.

## Generating Polar Checkout Sessions

This endpoint will be responsible for creating a new checkout session, redirecting the user to the Polar Checkout page & redirect back to a configured confirmation page.

Go ahead and create a new entry in your `routes/web.php` file:

```php  theme={null}
// routes/web.php
Route::get('/checkout', [CheckoutController::class, 'handle']);
```

Next, create the `CheckoutController` class in the `app/Http/Controllers` directory:

```php  theme={null}
// app/Http/Controllers/CheckoutController.php
<?php

namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use Illuminate\Http\Request;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Http;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Log;

class CheckoutController extends Controller
{
    public function handle(Request $request)
    {
        $productPriceId = $request->query('priceId', '');
        // Polar will replace {CHECKOUT_ID} with the actual checkout ID upon a confirmed checkout
        $confirmationUrl = $request->getSchemeAndHttpHost() . '/confirmation?checkout_id={CHECKOUT_ID}';

        // Change from sandbox-api.polar.sh -> api.polar.sh when ready to go live
        // And don't forget to update the .env file with the correct POLAR_ORGANIZATION_ID and POLAR_WEBHOOK_SECRET
        $result = Http::withHeaders([
            'Authorization' => 'Bearer ' . env('POLAR_API_KEY'),
            'Content-Type' => 'application/json',
        ])->post('https://sandbox-api.polar.sh/v1/checkouts/custom/', [
            'product_price_id' => $productPriceId,
            'success_url' => $confirmationUrl,
            'payment_processor' => 'stripe',
        ]);

        $data = $result->json();

        $checkoutUrl = $data['url'];

        return redirect($checkoutUrl);
    }
}
```

We can now easily create a checkout session & redirect there by creating a link to `/checkout?priceId={priceId}`. Just like we did when displaying the products above.

Upon Checkout success, the user will be redirected to the confirmation page.

## Creating the Confirmation Page

Create a new entry in your `routes/web.php` file:

```php  theme={null}
// routes/web.php
Route::get('/confirmation', [ConfirmationController::class, 'handle']);
```

Next, create the `ConfirmationController` class in the `app/Http/Controllers` directory:

```php  theme={null}
// app/Http/Controllers/ConfirmationController.php
<?php

namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use Illuminate\Http\Request;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Http;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Log;

class ConfirmationController extends Controller
{
    public function handle(Request $request)
    {
        // Change from sandbox-api.polar.sh -> api.polar.sh when ready to go live
        // And don't forget to update the .env file with the correct POLAR_ORGANIZATION_ID and POLAR_WEBHOOK_SECRET
        $data = Http::withHeaders([
            'Authorization' => 'Bearer ' . env('POLAR_API_KEY'),
            'Content-Type' => 'application/json',
        ])->get('https://sandbox-api.polar.sh/v1/checkouts/custom/' . $request->query('checkout_id'));

        $checkout = $data->json();

        Log::info(json_encode($checkout, JSON_PRETTY_PRINT));

        return view('confirmation', ['checkout' => $checkout]);
    }
}
```

The checkout is not considered "successful" yet however. It's initially marked as `confirmed` until you've received a webhook event `checkout.updated` with a status set to `succeeded`. We'll cover this in the next section.

## Handling Polar Webhooks

Polar can send you events about various things happening in your organization. This is very useful for keeping your database in sync with Polar checkouts, orders, subscriptions, etc.

Configuring a webhook is simple. Head over to your organization's settings page and click on the "Add Endpoint" button to create a new webhook.

### Tunneling webhook events to your local development environment

If you're developing locally, you can use a tool like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to tunnel webhook events to your local development environment. This will allow you to test your webhook handlers without deploying them to a live server.

Run the following command to start an ngrok tunnel:

```bash Terminal theme={null}
ngrok http 3000
```

### Add Webhook Endpoint

1. Point the Webhook to `your-app.com/api/webhook/polar`. This must be an absolute URL which Polar can reach. If you use ngrok, the URL will look something like this: `https://<your-ngrok-id>.ngrok-free.app/api/webhook/polar`.
2. Select which events you want to be notified about. You can read more about the available events in the [Events section](/api-reference#webhooks).
3. Generate a secret key to sign the requests. This will allow you to verify that the requests are truly coming from Polar.
4. Add the secret key to your environment variables.

```bash Terminal theme={null}
# .env
POLAR_API_KEY="polar_oat..."
POLAR_WEBHOOK_SECRET="..."
```

### Setting up the Webhook handler

First, we need to install the standard-webhooks package to properly decode the incoming webhook payloads.

```bash Terminal theme={null}
composer require standard-webhooks/standard-webhooks:dev-main
```

Go and add a `routes/api.php` file and add the following entry:

```php  theme={null}
// routes/api.php
Route::webhooks('/webhook/polar');
```

Make sure that it is included in the Bootstrap file.

```php  theme={null}
// bootstrap/app.php
<?php

use Illuminate\Foundation\Application;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Configuration\Exceptions;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Configuration\Middleware;

return Application::configure(basePath: dirname(__DIR__))
    ->withRouting(
        web: __DIR__.'/../routes/web.php',
        api: __DIR__.'/../routes/api.php',
        commands: __DIR__.'/../routes/console.php',
        health: '/up',
    )
    ->withMiddleware(function (Middleware $middleware) {
        //
    })
    ->withExceptions(function (Exceptions $exceptions) {
        //
    })->create();
```

We will use Spatie's Webhook Client to handle the webhook events. It will automatically verify the signature of the requests, and dispatch the payload to a job queue for processing.

```bash Terminal theme={null}
composer require spatie/laravel-webhook-client
```

Let's publish the config:

```bash Terminal theme={null}
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Spatie\WebhookClient\WebhookClientServiceProvider" --tag="webhook-client-config"
```

This will create a new file called webhook-client.php in the config folder.

We need to adjust it to properly verify the signature of the requests.

```php  theme={null}
// config/webhook-client.php
<?php
return [
    'configs' => [
        [
            /*
             * This package supports multiple webhook receiving endpoints. If you only have
             * one endpoint receiving webhooks, you can use 'default'.
             */
            'name' => 'default',

            /*
             * We expect that every webhook call will be signed using a secret. This secret
             * is used to verify that the payload has not been tampered with.
             */
            'signing_secret' => env('POLAR_WEBHOOK_SECRET'),

            /*
             * The name of the header containing the signature.
             */
            'signature_header_name' => 'webhook-signature',

            /*
             *  This class will verify that the content of the signature header is valid.
             *
             * It should implement \Spatie\WebhookClient\SignatureValidator\SignatureValidator
             */
            // 'signature_validator' => \Spatie\WebhookClient\SignatureValidator\DefaultSignatureValidator::class,
            'signature_validator' => App\Handler\PolarSignature::class,

            /*
             * This class determines if the webhook call should be stored and processed.
             */
            'webhook_profile' => \Spatie\WebhookClient\WebhookProfile\ProcessEverythingWebhookProfile::class,

            /*
             * This class determines the response on a valid webhook call.
             */
            'webhook_response' => \Spatie\WebhookClient\WebhookResponse\DefaultRespondsTo::class,

            /*
             * The classname of the model to be used to store webhook calls. The class should
             * be equal or extend Spatie\WebhookClient\Models\WebhookCall.
             */
            'webhook_model' => \Spatie\WebhookClient\Models\WebhookCall::class,

            /*
             * In this array, you can pass the headers that should be stored on
             * the webhook call model when a webhook comes in.
             *
             * To store all headers, set this value to `*`.
             */
            'store_headers' => [],

            /*
             * The class name of the job that will process the webhook request.
             *
             * This should be set to a class that extends \Spatie\WebhookClient\Jobs\ProcessWebhookJob.
             */
            'process_webhook_job' => App\Handler\ProcessWebhook::class,
        ],
    ],

    /*
     * The integer amount of days after which models should be deleted.
     *
     * 7 deletes all records after 1 week. Set to null if no models should be deleted.
     */
    'delete_after_days' => 30,
];
```

### Preparing the database

By default, all webhook calls get saved into the database. So, we need to publish the migration that will hold the records. So run:

```bash Terminal theme={null}
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Spatie\WebhookClient\WebhookClientServiceProvider" --tag="webhook-client-migrations"
```

This will create a new migration file in the “database/migration” folder.

Then run `php artisan migrate` to run the migration.

### Setting up the queue system

Before we set up our job handler — let’s set up our queue system

Go to your “.env” file and set the QUEUE\_CONNECTION=database — you can decide to use other connections like redis.

Let’s create our jobs table by running php artisan queue:table and then run the migration using php artisan migrate.

### Create the Handlers

The next thing we do is to create a folder named Handler inside the app folder. Then inside this app/Handler, create two files which are

* PolarSignature.php
* ProcessWebhook.php

Inside app/Handler/PolarSignature.php, what we want to do is to validate that the request came from Polar. Add the code to that file.

```php  theme={null}
// app/Handler/PolarSignature.php
<?php

namespace App\Handler;

use Illuminate\Http\Request;
use Spatie\WebhookClient\Exceptions\WebhookFailed;
use Spatie\WebhookClient\WebhookConfig;
use Spatie\WebhookClient\SignatureValidator\SignatureValidator;

class PolarSignature implements SignatureValidator
{
    public function isValid(Request $request, WebhookConfig $config): bool
    {
        $signingSecret = base64_encode($config->signingSecret);
        $wh = new \StandardWebhooks\Webhook($signingSecret);

        return boolval( $wh->verify($request->getContent(), array(
            "webhook-id" => $request->header("webhook-id"),
            "webhook-signature" => $request->header("webhook-signature"),
            "webhook-timestamp" => $request->header("webhook-timestamp"),
        )));
    }
}
```

Great. So the other file app/Handler/ProcessWebhook.php extends the ProcessWebhookJob class which holds the WebhookCall variables containing each job’s detail.

```php  theme={null}
// app/Handler/ProcessWebhook.php
<?php

namespace App\Handler;

use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Log;
use Spatie\WebhookClient\Jobs\ProcessWebhookJob;

class ProcessWebhook extends ProcessWebhookJob
{
    public function handle()
    {
        $decoded = json_decode($this->webhookCall, true);
        $data = $decoded['payload'];

        switch ($data['type']) {
            case "checkout.created":
                // Handle the checkout created event
                break;
            case "checkout.updated":
                // Handle the checkout updated event
                break;
            case "subscription.created":
                // Handle the subscription created event
                break;
            case "subscription.updated":
                // Handle the subscription updated event
                break;
            case "subscription.active":
                // Handle the subscription active event
                break;
            case "subscription.revoked":
                // Handle the subscription revoked event
                break;
            case "subscription.canceled":
                // Handle the subscription canceled event
                break;
            default:
                // Handle unknown event
                Log::info($data['type']);
                break;
        }

        //Acknowledge you received the response
        http_response_code(200);
    }
}
```

Our application is ready to receive webhook requests.

Don’t forget to run `php artisan queue:listen` to process the jobs.

### Tips

If you're keeping track of active and inactive subscriptions in your database, make sure to handle the `subscription.active` and `subscription.revoked` events accordingly.

The cancellation of a subscription is handled by the `subscription.canceled`
event. The user has probably canceled their subscription before the end of the
billing period. Do not revoke any kind of access immediately, but rather wait
until the end of the billing period or when you receive the
`subscription.revoked` event.

## Notifying the client about the event

If you're building a real-time application, you might want to notify the client about the event. On the confirmation-page, you can listen for the `checkout.updated` event and update the UI accordingly when it reaches the succeeded status.

## Polar Laravel Example App

We've created a simple example Laravel application that you can use as a reference

# Integrate Polar with Next.js
Source: https://polar.sh/docs/guides/nextjs

In this guide, we'll show you how to integrate Polar with Next.js.

Feel free to use our quick-start script to get started inside a new Next.js project:

```bash Terminal theme={null}
# Inside a new Next.js project
npx polar-init
```

Consider following this guide while using the Polar Sandbox Environment. This will allow you to test your integration without affecting your production data.

[A complete code-example of this guide can be found on GitHub](https://github.com/polarsource/polar-next).

## Install the Polar JavaScript SDK

To get started, you need to install the Polar JavaScript SDK and the Polar Nextjs helper package. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash Terminal theme={null}
pnpm install @polar-sh/sdk @polar-sh/nextjs
```

## Setting up environment variables

### Polar Access Token

To authenticate with Polar, you need to create an access token, and supply it to Next.js using a `POLAR_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variable.

You can create an organization access token from your organization settings.

## Configuring a Polar API Client

To interact with the Polar API, you need to create a new instance of the `Polar` class. This class uses the provided access token to authenticate with the Polar API.

```typescript  theme={null}
// src/polar.ts
import { Polar } from "@polar-sh/sdk";

export const api = new Polar({
  accessToken: process.env.POLAR_ACCESS_TOKEN!,
  server: "sandbox", // Use this option if you're using the sandbox environment - else use 'production' or omit the parameter
});
```

Remember to replace `sandbox` with `production` when you're ready to switch to the production environment.

## Generating Polar Checkout Sessions

Next up, we need to create a checkout endpoint to handle the creation of checkout sessions.

Go ahead and create a new GET route in Next.js.

```typescript  theme={null}
// src/app/checkout/route.ts
import { Checkout } from "@polar-sh/nextjs";

export const GET = Checkout({
  accessToken: process.env.POLAR_ACCESS_TOKEN!,
  successUrl: "/confirmation?checkout_id={CHECKOUT_ID}",
  server: "sandbox", // Use this option if you're using the sandbox environment - else use 'production' or omit the parameter
});
```

## Handling Polar Webhooks

Polar can send you events about various things happening in your organization. This is very useful for keeping your database in sync with Polar checkouts, orders, subscriptions, etc.

Configuring a webhook is simple. Head over to your organization's settings page and click on the "Add Endpoint" button to create a new webhook.

### Tunneling webhook events to your local development environment

If you're developing locally, you can use a tool like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to tunnel webhook events to your local development environment. This will allow you to test your webhook handlers without deploying them to a live server.

Run the following command to start an ngrok tunnel:

```bash Terminal theme={null}
ngrok http 3000
```

### Add Webhook Endpoint

1. Point the Webhook to `your-app.com/api/webhook/polar`. This must be an absolute URL which Polar can reach. If you use ngrok, the URL will look something like this: `https://<your-ngrok-id>.ngrok-free.app/api/webhook/polar`.
2. Select which events you want to be notified about. You can read more about the available events in the [Events section](/api-reference#webhooks).
3. Generate a secret key to sign the requests. This will allow you to verify that the requests are truly coming from Polar.
4. Add the secret key to your environment variables.

```bash Terminal theme={null}
# .env
POLAR_ACCESS_TOKEN="polar_pat..."
POLAR_WEBHOOK_SECRET="..."
```

### Setting up the Webhook handler

```typescript  theme={null}
// src/app/api/webhook/polar/route.ts
import { Webhooks } from "@polar-sh/nextjs";

export const POST = Webhooks({
	webhookSecret: process.env.POLAR_WEBHOOK_SECRET,
	onPayload: async (payload) => // Handle payload...
});
```

The webhook event is now verified and you can proceed to handle the payload data.

### Handling Webhook Events

Depending on which events you've subscribed to, you'll receive different payloads. This is where you can update your database, send notifications, etc.

```typescript  theme={null}
// src/app/api/webhook/polar/route.ts
import { Webhooks } from "@polar-sh/nextjs";

export const POST = Webhooks({
  webhookSecret: process.env.POLAR_WEBHOOK_SECRET,
  onPayload: async (payload) => ...,
  onOrderCreated: async (order) => ...,
  onCustomerStateChanged: async (customerState) => ...,
  ...
});
```

### Notifying the client about the event

If you're building a real-time application, you might want to notify the client about the event. On the confirmation-page, you can listen for the `checkout.updated` event and update the UI accordingly when it reaches the succeeded status.

# How to schedule subscription downgrades with Upstash QStash
Source: https://polar.sh/docs/guides/schedule-subscription-downgrades-qstash

Learn how to automatically schedule subscription downgrades at the end of the current billing period using the Polar API and Upstash QStash.

## Overview

When managing subscriptions, you may want to schedule downgrades to take effect at the end of the current billing period rather than immediately. This ensures customers receive the full value of their current subscription while automatically transitioning to another tier when their billing period ends.

## Prerequisites

* A [Polar API access token](/integrate/authentication)
* An [Upstash QStash](https://upstash.com/qstash) account
* A server endpoint that can receive HTTP requests
  * [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/announcements/v20-release-announce) or your preferred backend language installed

## Step 1: Set Up Environment Variables

Store your API credentials securely in environment variables.

```bash Terminal theme={null}
# Polar API credentials
POLAR_MODE="sandbox" # can be "production"
POLAR_ACCESS_TOKEN="polar_pat_..."

# Upstash QStash credentials
QSTASH_URL="https://qstash.upstash.io"
QSTASH_TOKEN="ey...="
QSTASH_CURRENT_SIGNING_KEY="sig_..."
QSTASH_NEXT_SIGNING_KEY="sig_..."

# Your application URL
APP_URL="https://localhost:3000"
```

<Info>
  You can find your QStash token in the [Upstash Console](https://console.upstash.com/qstash) under the **QStash** section.
</Info>

## Step 2: Schedule the Downgrade with QStash

Use Upstash QStash to schedule an HTTP request to your downgrade endpoint at the end of the billing period.

Here's a complete Next.js API route that schedules a downgrade:

```tsx title="app/api/schedule-downgrade/route.ts" theme={null}
import { Polar } from "@polar-sh/sdk";
import { Client } from "@upstash/qstash";
import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from "next/server";

const polar = new Polar({
  server: process.env.POLAR_MODE,
  accessToken: process.env.POLAR_ACCESS_TOKEN,
});

const qstash = new Client({
  token: process.env.QSTASH_TOKEN,
});

export async function POST(req: NextRequest) {
  try {
    const { subscriptionId, newProductId } = await req.json();

    // Step 1: Fetch current subscription details
    const subscription = await polar.subscriptions.get({
      id: subscriptionId,
    });

    if (!subscription.currentPeriodEnd) {
      return NextResponse.json(
        { error: "Subscription has no current period end date" },
        { status: 400 }
      );
    }

    // Step 2: Calculate when to execute the downgrade
    const executeAt = new Date(subscription.currentPeriodEnd);

    // Step 3: Schedule the downgrade with QStash
    const result = await qstash.publishJSON({
      retries: 1,
      body: {
        subscriptionId,
        newProductId,
        customerId: subscription.customerId,
      },
      url: `${process.env.APP_URL}/api/execute-downgrade`,
      delay: Math.floor((executeAt.getTime() - (new Date()).getTime()) / 1000),
    });

    // Step 4: Optionally store the scheduled task
    // You might want to store this in your database
    console.log(`Scheduled downgrade for subscription ${subscriptionId}`);
    console.log(`Will execute at: ${executeAt.toISOString()}`);
    console.log(`QStash message ID: ${result.messageId}`);

    return NextResponse.json({
      success: true,
      messageId: result.messageId,
      scheduledFor: executeAt.toISOString(),
    });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Failed to schedule downgrade:", error);
    return NextResponse.json(
      { error: "Failed to schedule downgrade" },
      { status: 500 }
    );
  }
}
```

<Tip>
  Store the QStash `messageId` in your database along with the subscription ID. This allows you to track or cancel scheduled downgrades if needed.
</Tip>

## Step 3: Create the Downgrade Execution Endpoint

Create an endpoint that QStash will call at the scheduled time to execute the downgrade.

Here's a completed Next.js API route for downgrade:

```tsx title="app/api/execute-downgrade/route.ts" theme={null}
import { Polar } from "@polar-sh/sdk";
import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from "next/server";
import { verifySignatureAppRouter } from "@upstash/qstash/nextjs";
import { SubscriptionProrationBehavior } from "@polar-sh/sdk/models/components/subscriptionprorationbehavior.js";

const polar = new Polar({
  server: process.env.POLAR_MODE,
  accessToken: process.env.POLAR_ACCESS_TOKEN,
});

async function handler(req: NextRequest) {
  try {
    const { subscriptionId, newProductId, customerId } = await req.json();

    console.log(`Executing downgrade for subscription ${subscriptionId}`);

    // Fetch the subscription to verify it's still active
    const subscription = await polar.subscriptions.get({
      id: subscriptionId,
    });

    // Verify subscription is still active
    if (subscription.status !== "active" && subscription.status !== "trialing") {
      console.log(`Subscription ${subscriptionId} is not active, skipping downgrade`);
      return NextResponse.json({
        success: false,
        reason: "Subscription is not active",
      });
    }

    // Check if already on the target product
    if (subscription.productId === newProductId) {
      console.log(`Subscription already on product ${newProductId}`);
      return NextResponse.json({
        success: true,
        reason: "Already on target product",
      });
    }

    // Execute the downgrade
    const updatedSubscription = await polar.subscriptions.update({
      id: subscriptionId,
      subscriptionUpdate: {
        productId: newProductId,
        prorationBehavior: SubscriptionProrationBehavior.Invoice,
      },
    });

    console.log(`Successfully downgraded subscription ${subscriptionId}`);
    console.log(`New product: ${updatedSubscription.product.name}`);

    return NextResponse.json({
      success: true,
      subscription: updatedSubscription,
    });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Failed to execute downgrade:", error);

    // Return 200 to prevent QStash retries for certain errors
    if (error instanceof Error && error.message.includes("not found")) {
      return NextResponse.json(
        { success: false, error: "Subscription not found" },
        { status: 200 }
      );
    }

    // Let QStash retry for other errors
    return NextResponse.json(
      { error: "Failed to execute downgrade" },
      { status: 500 }
    );
  }
}

// Verify QStash signature to ensure requests come from QStash
export const POST = verifySignatureAppRouter(handler);
```

<Warning>
  **Security**: Always verify QStash signatures to ensure requests are coming from QStash and not malicious actors. The `verifySignatureAppRouter` function handles this automatically.
</Warning>

## Step 4: Test Your Integration

Test the complete flow to ensure downgrades are scheduled and executed correctly.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Test in Sandbox Environment">
    Use Polar's [sandbox environment](/integrate/sandbox) to test without affecting production data.

    ```tsx  theme={null}
    const polar = new Polar({
      // Use sandbox for testing
      server: process.env.POLAR_MODE,
      accessToken: process.env.POLAR_ACCESS_TOKEN,
    });
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Schedule a Test Downgrade">
    Create a test subscription and schedule a downgrade for a few minutes in the future.

    ```tsx  theme={null}
    // Schedule downgrade 5 minutes from now for testing
    const executeAt = new Date(Date.now() + 5 * 60 * 1000);

    const result = await fetch("/api/schedule-downgrade", {
      method: "POST",
      headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        subscriptionId: "sub_test_xxxxx",
        newProductId: "prod_basic_xxxxx",
      }),
    });
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Monitor QStash Logs">
    Check the [Upstash Console](https://console.upstash.com/qstash) to see scheduled messages and their status.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify the Downgrade">
    After the scheduled time, verify the subscription was downgraded:

    ```tsx  theme={null}
    const subscription = await polar.subscriptions.get({
      id: "sub_test_xxxxx",
    });

    console.log("Current product:", subscription.product.name);
    ```
  </Step>

# Implementing Seat-Based Pricing
Source: https://polar.sh/docs/guides/seat-based-pricing

Complete guide to implementing team products with seat-based pricing

This guide walks you through implementing seat-based pricing for team products, from creating the product to handling seat assignments and claims.

## What you'll build

By the end of this guide, you'll have:

* A seat-based product with tiered pricing (subscription or one-time)
* Checkout flow for purchasing seats
* Seat assignment and management interface
* Claim flow for team members

<Info>
  This guide covers both **subscription-based** and **one-time purchase** seat-based products. The implementation is similar for both, with key differences in scaling and billing.
</Info>

## Prerequisites

* Polar organization with `seat_based_pricing_enabled` feature flag
* Polar SDK installed (`npm install @polar-sh/sdk` or `pip install polar-sdk`)
  * **Important:** Seat-based pricing requires the latest version of the SDK. Make sure to update to the latest version to access all seat-based pricing features.
* Basic understanding of Polar products and subscriptions

<Warning>
  Seat-based pricing is currently in **private beta**. To enable the `seat_based_pricing_enabled` feature flag for your organization, please contact our support team.
</Warning>

## Step 1: Create a seat-based product

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Products">
    In the Polar dashboard, go to **Products** and click **Create Product**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure basic settings">
    Set your product name, description, and media. For example:

    * **Subscription**: Team Pro Plan - Professional features for your entire team
    * **One-time**: Enterprise License Pack - Perpetual team licenses
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select seat-based pricing">
    Under **Pricing**:

    * **Product type**: Choose **Subscription** for recurring billing or **One-time** for perpetual licenses
    * **Billing cycle** (subscriptions only): Monthly or Yearly
    * **Pricing type**: Seat-based
    * **Min seats**: 1 (or your minimum team size)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure pricing tiers">
    Define your volume-based pricing:

    | Tier | Max Seats | Price per Seat |
    | ---- | --------- | -------------- |
    | 1    | 4         | \$10/month     |
    | 2    | 9         | \$9/month      |
    | 3    | Unlimited | \$8/month      |

    Example: A team purchasing 6 seats pays 6 × $9 = $54/month.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add benefits">
    Configure benefits that seat holders will receive:

    * License Keys
    * File Downloads
    * Discord roles
    * Custom benefits

    <Info>
      Benefits are granted when seats are claimed, not at purchase time.
    </Info>
  </Step>
</Steps>

You can also create seat-based products via API:

**Subscription example:**

```typescript  theme={null}
const subscriptionProduct = await polar.products.create({
  name: "Team Pro Plan",
  organization_id: "org_123",
  is_recurring: true,
  prices: [{
    type: "recurring",
    recurring_interval: "month",
    amount_type: "seat_based",
    price_currency: "usd",
    seat_tiers: [
      { min_seats: 1, max_seats: 4, price_per_seat: 1000 },   // $10/month
      { min_seats: 5, max_seats: 9, price_per_seat: 900 },    // $9/month
      { min_seats: 10, max_seats: null, price_per_seat: 800 } // $8/month
    ]
  }]
});
```

**One-time purchase example:**

```typescript  theme={null}
const oneTimeProduct = await polar.products.create({
  name: "Enterprise License Pack",
  organization_id: "org_123",
  is_recurring: false,
  prices: [{
    type: "one_time",
    amount_type: "seat_based",
    price_currency: "usd",
    seat_tiers: [
      { min_seats: 1, max_seats: 10, price_per_seat: 5000 },   // $50 per seat
      { min_seats: 11, max_seats: 50, price_per_seat: 4500 },  // $45 per seat
      { min_seats: 51, max_seats: null, price_per_seat: 4000 } // $40 per seat
    ]
  }]
});
```

## Step 2: Implement checkout flow

Create a checkout session that allows customers to select seat quantity:

```typescript  theme={null}
const checkout = await polar.checkouts.create({
  product_price_id: "price_123",
  seats: 5, // Customer selects quantity
  success_url: "https://yourapp.com/success",
  customer_email: "billing@company.com"
});

// Redirect to checkout.url
```

The checkout displays:

* Price per seat based on quantity
* Total amount
* Clear indication this is for team access

<Info>
  The checkout automatically calculates pricing based on your tiers. A customer selecting 5 seats will see the $9/seat price, totaling $45.
</Info>

## Step 3: Handle post-purchase webhook

Listen for purchase webhooks to know when a customer buys seats:

```typescript  theme={null}
// Webhook handler
app.post('/webhooks/polar', async (req, res) => {
  const event = req.body;

  // For subscriptions
  if (event.type === 'subscription.created') {
    const subscription = event.data;

    if (subscription.product.has_seat_based_price) {
      await notifyBillingManager(subscription.customer_id, {
        message: `Your ${subscription.seats}-seat subscription is active!`,
        manage_seats_url: `https://yourapp.com/seats/subscription/${subscription.id}`
      });
    }
  }

  // For one-time purchases
  if (event.type === 'order.created') {
    const order = event.data;

    if (order.seats) {
      await notifyBillingManager(order.customer_id, {
        message: `Your ${order.seats} perpetual seat licenses have been purchased!`,
        manage_seats_url: `https://yourapp.com/seats/order/${order.id}`
      });
    }
  }

  res.sendStatus(200);
});
```

## Step 4: Build seat management interface

Create an interface for billing managers to assign seats:

```typescript  theme={null}
// List available seats (works for both subscriptions and orders)
async function getSeatInfo(params: { subscription_id?: string; order_id?: string }) {
  const { seats, available_seats, total_seats } =
    await polar.customerSeats.list(params);

  return {
    seats,
    available: available_seats,
    total: total_seats,
    canAssign: available_seats > 0
  };
}

// Assign a seat (works for both subscriptions and orders)
async function assignSeat(
  params: { subscription_id?: string; order_id?: string },
  email: string,
  metadata?: Record<string, any>
) {
  try {
    const seat = await polar.customerSeats.assign({
      ...params,
      email: email,
      metadata: metadata // e.g., { department: "Engineering" }
    });

    return {
      success: true,
      seat: seat,
      message: `Invitation sent to ${email}`
    };
  } catch (error) {
    if (error.status === 400) {
      return {
        success: false,
        error: "No seats available or customer already has a seat"
      };
    }
    throw error;
  }
}

// Example usage:
// For subscriptions: getSeatInfo({ subscription_id: "sub_123" })
// For orders: getSeatInfo({ order_id: "order_456" })
```

Example UI component (React):

```tsx  theme={null}
function SeatManagement({ subscriptionId }: { subscriptionId: string }) {
  const [seatInfo, setSeatInfo] = useState(null);
  const [email, setEmail] = useState("");

  useEffect(() => {
    loadSeats();
  }, [subscriptionId]);

  async function loadSeats() {
    const info = await getSeatInfo(subscriptionId);
    setSeatInfo(info);
  }

  async function handleAssign() {
    const result = await assignSeat(subscriptionId, email, {
      role: "Developer"
    });

    if (result.success) {
      setEmail("");
      loadSeats(); // Refresh list
      toast.success("Invitation sent!");
    }
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Seat Management</h2>
      <p>{seatInfo?.available} of {seatInfo?.total} seats available</p>

      {/* Assign new seat */}
      <div>
        <input
          type="email"
          value={email}
          onChange={(e) => setEmail(e.target.value)}
          placeholder="team-member@company.com"
        />
        <button
          onClick={handleAssign}
          disabled={!seatInfo?.canAssign}
        >
          Assign Seat
        </button>
      </div>

      {/* List existing seats */}
      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Email</th>
            <th>Status</th>
            <th>Role</th>
            <th>Actions</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          {seatInfo?.seats.map(seat => (
            <tr key={seat.id}>
              <td>{seat.customer_email}</td>
              <td>
                <SeatStatusBadge status={seat.status} />
              </td>
              <td>{seat.seat_metadata?.role}</td>
              <td>
                {seat.status === 'pending' && (
                  <button onClick={() => resendInvitation(seat.id)}>
                    Resend
                  </button>
                )}
                {seat.status === 'claimed' && (
                  <button onClick={() => revokeSeat(seat.id)}>
                    Revoke
                  </button>
                )}
              </td>
            </tr>
          ))}
        </tbody>
      </table>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Step 5: Implement seat claim flow

When a team member receives an invitation email, they'll click a link with the invitation token. Build a claim page:

```typescript  theme={null}
// Claim page route: /claim?token=abc123...

async function handleClaimPage(token: string) {
  // Get claim information (no auth required)
  const claimInfo = await polar.customerSeats.getClaimInfo({
    invitation_token: token
  });

  if (!claimInfo.can_claim) {
    return {
      error: "This invitation has expired or already been claimed"
    };
  }

  return {
    product: claimInfo.product_name,
    organization: claimInfo.organization_name,
    email: claimInfo.customer_email
  };
}

async function claimSeat(token: string) {
  const { seat, customer_session_token } =
    await polar.customerSeats.claim({
      invitation_token: token
    });

  // Store the customer session token
  // This allows immediate portal access
  localStorage.setItem('polar_session', customer_session_token);

  return {
    success: true,
    seat: seat,
    sessionToken: customer_session_token
  };
}
```

Example claim page (React):

```tsx  theme={null}
function ClaimPage() {
  const [token] = useSearchParams();
  const [claimInfo, setClaimInfo] = useState(null);
  const [claiming, setClaiming] = useState(false);

  useEffect(() => {
    loadClaimInfo();
  }, [token]);

  async function loadClaimInfo() {
    const info = await handleClaimPage(token.get('token'));
    setClaimInfo(info);
  }

  async function handleClaim() {
    setClaiming(true);
    try {
      const result = await claimSeat(token.get('token'));

      // Redirect to customer portal
      window.location.href = `/portal?session=${result.sessionToken}`;
    } catch (error) {
      toast.error("Failed to claim seat");
      setClaiming(false);
    }
  }

  if (claimInfo?.error) {
    return <div>Error: {claimInfo.error}</div>;
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>You've been invited!</h1>
      <p>
        Join {claimInfo?.organization}'s {claimInfo?.product} plan
      </p>
      <p>Email: {claimInfo?.email}</p>

      <button onClick={handleClaim} disabled={claiming}>
        {claiming ? "Claiming..." : "Claim My Seat"}
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Step 6: Handle benefit granting

After a seat is claimed, benefits are granted automatically via background jobs. Listen for webhooks to track this:

```typescript  theme={null}
app.post('/webhooks/polar', async (req, res) => {
  const event = req.body;

  if (event.type === 'benefit_grant.created') {
    const grant = event.data;

    // A team member received their benefits
    console.log(`Benefit ${grant.benefit_id} granted to ${grant.customer_id}`);

    // Update your app (e.g., create license, grant access)
    await grantAccess(grant.customer_id, grant.benefit);
  }

  if (event.type === 'benefit_grant.revoked') {
    const grant = event.data;

    // A seat was revoked
    await revokeAccess(grant.customer_id, grant.benefit);
  }

  res.sendStatus(200);
});
```

## Step 7: Implement seat revocation

Allow billing managers to revoke seats:

```typescript  theme={null}
async function revokeSeat(seatId: string) {
  const revokedSeat = await polar.customerSeats.revoke({
    seat_id: seatId
  });

  // Benefits are automatically revoked via webhook
  return {
    success: true,
    seat: revokedSeat,
    message: "Seat revoked successfully"
  };
}
```

<Warning>
  Revoking a seat immediately removes access but does not issue a refund. The billing manager continues to pay for all purchased seats.
</Warning>

## Step 8: Handle scaling

**For subscriptions**, allow billing managers to add or reduce seats:

```typescript  theme={null}
async function addSeats(subscriptionId: string, newTotal: number) {
  // Update subscription seat count
  const subscription = await polar.subscriptions.update({
    id: subscriptionId,
    seats: newTotal
  });

  // New seats are immediately available for assignment
  return subscription;
}

async function reduceSeats(subscriptionId: string, newTotal: number) {
  const { seats } = await polar.customerSeats.list({
    subscription_id: subscriptionId
  });

  const claimedCount = seats.filter(s => s.status === 'claimed').length;

  if (newTotal < claimedCount) {
    throw new Error(
      `Cannot reduce to ${newTotal} seats. ${claimedCount} seats are currently claimed. Revoke seats first.`
    );
  }

  // Update will take effect at next renewal
  const subscription = await polar.subscriptions.update({
    id: subscriptionId,
    seats: newTotal
  });

  return subscription;
}
```

**For one-time purchases**, customers buy additional seats via new orders:

```typescript  theme={null}
async function purchaseMoreSeats(productId: string, additionalSeats: number) {
  // Create a new checkout for additional seats
  const checkout = await polar.checkouts.create({
    product_id: productId,
    seats: additionalSeats,
    success_url: "https://yourapp.com/success"
  });

  // Each order is independent with its own seat pool
  return checkout;
}
```

<Info>
  For one-time purchases, each order has its own independent seat pool. Customers can purchase additional seats anytime by creating a new order. All seats remain perpetual.
</Info>

## Best Practices

### 1. Validate seat availability

Always check available seats before showing the assignment form:

```typescript  theme={null}
if (available_seats === 0) {
  return (
    <div>
      All seats are assigned.
      <button onClick={upgradeSubscription}>
        Add More Seats
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### 2. Use metadata effectively

Store useful context in seat metadata:

```typescript  theme={null}
await polar.customerSeats.assign({
  subscription_id: subId,
  email: "dev@company.com",
  metadata: {
    department: "Engineering",
    role: "Senior Developer",
    cost_center: "R&D",
    manager: "jane@company.com"
  }
});
```

### 3. Handle expired tokens gracefully

```typescript  theme={null}
try {
  await claimSeat(token);
} catch (error) {
  if (error.status === 400) {
    // Show resend option
    return "This invitation has expired. Contact your admin to resend.";
  }
}
```

### 4. Track utilization

Monitor seat usage to identify upsell opportunities:

```typescript  theme={null}
const { seats, available_seats, total_seats } = await getSeatInfo(subId);
const utilization = ((total_seats - available_seats) / total_seats) * 100;

if (utilization > 80) {
  // Suggest adding more seats
  showUpgradePrompt();
}
```

### 5. Clear communication

Make it clear to billing managers that:

* They won't receive direct access to benefits
* Seats must be assigned to team members
* Revocation doesn't refund costs
* **For subscriptions**: Reducing seats requires revoking claims first
* **For one-time purchases**: Seats are perpetual and non-refundable

## Common Patterns

### Bulk seat assignment

```typescript  theme={null}
async function assignMultipleSeats(
  subscriptionId: string,
  emails: string[]
) {
  const results = await Promise.allSettled(
    emails.map(email =>
      polar.customerSeats.assign({
        subscription_id: subscriptionId,
        email: email
      })
    )
  );

  const succeeded = results.filter(r => r.status === 'fulfilled');
  const failed = results.filter(r => r.status === 'rejected');

  return {
    succeeded: succeeded.length,
    failed: failed.length,
    errors: failed.map(f => f.reason)
  };
}
```

### Syncing with your user system

```typescript  theme={null}
// When a user joins your system
async function onUserSignup(email: string, organizationId: string) {
  // Check if they have a pending seat
  const subscriptions = await getOrganizationSubscriptions(organizationId);

  for (const sub of subscriptions) {
    const { seats } = await polar.customerSeats.list({
      subscription_id: sub.id
    });

    const pendingSeat = seats.find(s =>
      s.status === 'pending' && s.customer_email === email
    );

    if (pendingSeat) {
      // Auto-claim on signup
      const claimLink = `/claim?token=${pendingSeat.invitation_token}`;
      return { shouldClaim: true, claimLink };
    }
  }
}
```

### Custom portal integration

```typescript  theme={null}
// Display team subscriptions in your app
async function getTeamSubscriptions(customerId: string) {
  const subs = await polar.customerPortal.seats.listSubscriptions({
    customer_id: customerId
  });

  return subs.map(sub => ({
    product: sub.product.name,
    status: sub.status,
    role: sub.seat_metadata?.role,
    expires: sub.current_period_end
  }));
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Seats not appearing

Ensure the feature flag is enabled:

```
seat_based_pricing_enabled: true
```

### Benefits not granted after claim

Check webhook logs for `benefit_grant.created` events. Benefits are granted asynchronously via background jobs.

### Cannot reduce seats

Make sure to revoke seats before reducing the subscription seat count. You cannot reduce below the currently claimed count.

### Claim link expired

Invitation tokens expire after 24 hours. Have the billing manager resend the invitation:

```typescript  theme={null}
await polar.customerSeats.resend({ seat_id: seatId });
```

## Next Steps

# How to Switch Checkout Theme
Source: https://polar.sh/docs/guides/theme-switch-in-checkout

Learn how to switch the theme in a checkout session and a checkout link.

## Changing the Theme for a Checkout Session Created via the API

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Checkout Session">
    Create a Checkout Session by following our [How to Create Checkout Session](/guides/create-checkout-session) guide and obtain the `url`.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Switch to dark theme">
    To switch to the dark theme, append the query parameter <code>theme=dark</code> to your checkout session URL as obtained earlier. For example, if your checkout session URL is:\
    <code>[https://polar.sh/checkout/polar\_c\_ES7DwhlyvlYTPNaLiccKqiwJPda43FIzer](https://polar.sh/checkout/polar_c_ES7DwhlyvlYTPNaLiccKqiwJPda43FIzer)</code>

    You should use:\
    <code>[https://polar.sh/checkout/polar\_c\_ES7DwhlyvlYTPNaLiccKqiwJPda43FIzer?theme=dark](https://polar.sh/checkout/polar_c_ES7DwhlyvlYTPNaLiccKqiwJPda43FIzer?theme=dark)</code>

    The checkout session then looks like below:

# Authentication
Source: https://polar.sh/docs/integrate/authentication



<Info>
  All bearer tokens should be kept private and never shared or exposed in client-side code.
</Info>

To authenticate requests, Polar API has two mechanisms.

1. [Organization Access Tokens (OAT)](/integrate/oat) - Recommended
2. [OAuth 2.0 Provider](/integrate/oauth2/introduction) (Partner Integrations)

## Organization Access Tokens (OAT)

They are tied to **one** of your organization. You can create them from your organization settings.

## Security

To protect your data and ensure the security of Polar, we've several mechanisms in place to automatically revoke tokens that may have been leaked publicly on the web.

In particular, we're part of the [GitHub Secret Scanning Program](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/secret-scanning/about-secret-scanning). If GitHub systems detect a Polar token in a code repository or public discussion, our systems are notified and the tokens are immediately revoked.

If you received an email about one of your token being leaked, it means that we were notified of such situation. The email contains the details about the nature of the token and the source of the leak.

In the future, it's crucial that you remain extra cautious about not leaking your tokens publicly online. You can read more about the good practices to manage secrets in the [OWASP Secrets Management Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Secrets_Management_Cheat_Sheet.html).

Customer State is a concept allowing you to query for the current state of a customer, including their active subscriptions and granted [benefits](/features/benefits/introduction), in a single [API call](/api-reference/customers/state-external) or single [webhook event](/api-reference/webhooks/customer.state_changed).

Combined with the [External ID](/features/customer-management#external-id) feature, you can get up-and-running in minutes.

## The customer state object

The customer state object contains:

* All the data about the customer.
* The list of their **active** subscriptions.
* The list of their **granted** benefits.
* The list of their **active** meters, with their current balance.

Thus, with that single object, you have all the required information to check if you should provision access to your service or not.

<Card title="Get Customer State by External ID" icon="ring" iconType="duotone" href="/api-reference/customers/state-external" horizontal>
  One endpoint to rule them all, using your own customer ID.
</Card>

<Card title="Get Customer State " icon="ring" iconType="duotone" href="/api-reference/customers/state" horizontal>
  The same one, but with internal Polar customer ID.
</Card>

## The `customer.state_changed` webhook

To be notified of the customer state changes, you can listen to the `customer.state_changed` webhook event. It's triggered when:

* Customer is created, updated or deleted.
* A subscription is created or updated.
* A benefit is granted or revoked.

By subscribing to this webhook event, you keep your system up-to-date and update your customer's access accordingly.

Supercharge your AI agents with Polar as a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server.

## What is MCP?

MCP is a protocol for integrating tools with AI agents. It can greatly enhance the capabilities of your AI agents by providing them with real-time data and context.

Polar offers a remote MCP server that you can connect to from most AI clients.

## How does it work?

You need a MCP-capable agent environment to use Polar over MCP. A few of them are Claude Desktop and Cursor.

## Connecting to Polar MCP

Polar provides two MCP servers:

* **Production**: `https://mcp.polar.sh/mcp/polar-mcp` - Connect to your live Polar organization
* **Sandbox**: `https://mcp.polar.sh/mcp/polar-sandbox` - Connect to the Polar sandbox environment for testing

When you can specify a MCP URL, use one of the URLs above depending on your environment.

If you have to specify a command, use:

```json  theme={null}
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Polar": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["mcp-remote", "https://mcp.polar.sh/mcp/polar-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

For sandbox:

```json  theme={null}
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Polar Sandbox": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["mcp-remote", "https://mcp.polar.sh/mcp/polar-sandbox"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Cursor

In `.cursor/mcp.json`, add:

```json  theme={null}
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Polar": {
      "url": "https://mcp.polar.sh/mcp/polar-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

For sandbox:

```json  theme={null}
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Polar Sandbox": {
      "url": "https://mcp.polar.sh/mcp/polar-sandbox"
    }
  }
}
```

### Windsurf

In `mcp_config.json`, add:

```json  theme={null}
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Polar": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["mcp-remote", "https://mcp.polar.sh/mcp/polar-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

For sandbox:

```json  theme={null}
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Polar Sandbox": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["mcp-remote", "https://mcp.polar.sh/mcp/polar-sandbox"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Codex

Add the following to your `~/.codex/config.toml`:

```toml  theme={null}
[features]
rmcp_client = true

[mcp_servers.polar]
type = "http"
url = "https://mcp.polar.sh/mcp/polar-mcp"
```

Then run:

```sh  theme={null}
codex mcp login polar
```

For sandbox:

```toml  theme={null}
[features]
rmcp_client = true

[mcp_servers.polar_sandbox]
type = "http"
url = "https://mcp.polar.sh/mcp/polar-sandbox"
```

Then run:

```sh  theme={null}
codex mcp login polar_sandbox
```

### Claude Code

Run the following command:

```
claude mcp add --transport http "Polar" "https://mcp.polar.sh/mcp/polar-mcp"
```

For sandbox:

```
claude mcp add --transport http "Polar Sandbox" "https://mcp.polar.sh/mcp/polar-sandbox"
```

### ChatGPT

MCP is only available for paid users in beta on ChatGPT web, by enabling Developer Mode.

Once Developer Mode is enabled, go to *Settings* → *Connectors* and add the MCP server using `https://mcp.polar.sh/mcp/polar-mcp`.

For sandbox, use `https://mcp.polar.sh/mcp/polar-sandbox` instead.

### Claude Desktop

Go to *Settings* → *Connectors* and click *Add custom connector*.

Name it "Polar" and add `https://mcp.polar.sh/mcp/polar-mcp` as the server URL.

For sandbox, use `https://mcp.polar.sh/mcp/polar-sandbox` as the server URL instead.

Save, and click *Connect* to connect to your Polar organization.


# OAuth 2.0 Connect
Source: https://polar.sh/docs/integrate/oauth2/connect



## Authorize

To start the authorization flow you need to redirect the user to the authorization URL. It looks like this:

```
https://polar.sh/oauth2/authorize?
  response_type=code
  &client_id=CLIENT_ID
  &redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fexample.com%2Fcallback
  &scope=openid%20email
```

The parameters are the one described in the [OpenID Connect specification](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#AuthRequest). The most important ones are:

<ParamField path="response_type=code" type="string" required>
  Indicates that you want to use the authorization code flow. Most common and
  the only one supported by Polar.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="client_id" type="string" required>
  The Client ID you got when creating the OAuth 2.0 client.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="redirect_uri" type="string" required>
  The URL where the user will be redirected after granting access to their data.
  Make sure you declared it when creating the OAuth2 client.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="scope" type="string" required>
  A space-separated list of scopes you want to ask for. Make sure they are part
  of the scopes you declared when creating the OAuth2 client.
</ParamField>

If you redirect the user to this URL, they'll see a page asking them to grant access to their data, corresponding to the scopes you asked for. By default, the user will also be prompted to select one of their organizations, as Polar generates organization-level access tokens by default.

If they allow it and select an organization, they'll be redirected to your `redirect_uri` with a `code` parameter in the query string. This code is a one-time code that you can exchange for an access token.

To skip the organization selection and get a user-scoped token instead, you can add `sub_type=user` to the authorization URL:

```
https://polar.sh/oauth2/authorize?
  response_type=code
  &client_id=CLIENT_ID
  &redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fexample.com%2Fcallback
  &scope=openid%20email
  &sub_type=user
```

#### Exchange code token

Once you have the authorization code, you can exchange it for an access token. To do so, you'll need to make a `POST` request to the token endpoint. This call needs to be authenticated with the Client ID and Client Secret you got when creating the OAuth2 client.

Here is an example with cURL:

```bash Terminal theme={null}
curl -X POST https://api.polar.sh/v1/oauth2/token \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
  -d 'grant_type=authorization_code&code=AUTHORIZATION_CODE&client_id=CLIENT_ID&client_secret=CLIENT_SECRET&redirect_uri=https://example.com/callback'
```

You should get the following response:

```json  theme={null}
{
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "access_token": "polar_at_XXX",
  "expires_in": 864000,
  "refresh_token": "polar_rt_XXX",
  "scope": "openid email",
  "id_token": "ID_TOKEN"
}
```

The `access_token` will allow you to make authenticated API requests on behalf of the user. The `refresh_token` is a long-lived token that you can use to get new access tokens when the current one expires. The `id_token` is a signed JWT token containing information about the user, as per the [OpenID Connect specification](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#IDToken).

#### Organization vs User Access Tokens

By default, Polar OAuth2 flow generates **organization-level** access tokens. These tokens are tied to a specific organization rather than a user, allowing requests to operate only on that organization's data, which improves privacy and security.

When using the default flow, the user will be prompted to select one of their organizations before allowing access to their data:

```
https://polar.sh/oauth2/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=polar_ci_j3X95_MgfdSCeCd2qkFnUw&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fexample.com%2Fcallback&scope=openid%20email
```

To request a **user-scoped** access token instead, you need to explicitly add the parameter `sub_type=user` to the authorization URL:

```
https://polar.sh/oauth2/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=polar_ci_j3X95_MgfdSCeCd2qkFnUw&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fexample.com%2Fcallback&scope=openid%20email&sub_type=user
```

The rest of the flow remains unchanged. The access token you'll get will be tied to either the selected organization (default) or the user (when explicitly requested).

#### Public Clients

Public clients are clients where the Client Secret can't be kept safe, as it would be accessible by the final user. This is the case for SPA, mobile applications, or any client running on the user's device.

In this case, **and only if the client is configured as a Public Client**, the request to the token endpoint won't require the `client_secret` parameter. However, the [PKCE](https://oauth.net/2/pkce/) method will be required to maximize security.

### Make authenticated requests

Once you have an access token, either from a Personal Access Token or from the OpenID Connect flow, you can make authenticated requests to the API. Here is a simple example with cURL:

```bash Terminal theme={null}
curl -X GET https://api.polar.sh/v1/oauth2/userinfo \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer polar_at_XXX'
```


# Introduction
Source: https://polar.sh/docs/integrate/oauth2/introduction

For partners building services and extensions for Polar customers

### OpenID Connect (OAuth2)

Only use our **OpenID Connect** in case you want to act on the behalf of other users via our API, e.g building an app/service for Polar customers. Otherwise, always use an **Organization Access Token (OAT)** to integrate Polar for your own service.

Polar implements the [OpenID Connect specification](https://openid.net/developers/how-connect-works/) to enable third-party authentication. It's a layer on top of the OAuth2 framework aiming at making integration more standard and predictable.

In particular, it comes with a **discovery endpoint** allowing compatible clients to automatically work with the OpenID Connect server. Here is Polar's one:

[OpenID Configuration](https://api.polar.sh/.well-known/openid-configuration)


# Create an OAuth 2.0 Client
Source: https://polar.sh/docs/integrate/oauth2/setup



Before being able to make authentication requests, you'll need an **OAuth2 Client**. It's the entity that'll identify you, as a third-party developer, between Polar and the final user.

You can manage them from your [User Settings](https://polar.sh/settings#oauth)

Here are the required fields:

* *Application Name*: the name of the application that'll be shown to the final users.
* *Client Type*: the type of client you are creating. [Read more](#public-clients)
* *Redirect URIs*: for security reasons, you need to declare your application URL where the users will be redirected after granting access to their data.
  <Note>
    When configuring your OAuth client, you must use an `https://` URL for security reasons. We block `http://` URLs, except when the hostname is `localhost`. This exception allows you to use `http://localhost` for convenient testing in development mode.
  </Note>
* *Scopes*: the list of scopes your app will be able to ask for. To improve privacy and security, select only the scopes you really need for your application.
* *Homepage URL*: the URL of your application. It'll be shown to the final users on the authorization page.

Optionally, you can also add a **logo**, **terms of service** and **privacy policy** URL. They'll all be shown to the final users on the authorization page.

Once your client is created, you'll get a **Client ID** and a **Client Secret**. You'll need those values to make authentication requests.

Those values are super sensitive and should be kept secret. They allow making authentication requests on Polar!


# Sandbox Environment
Source: https://polar.sh/docs/integrate/sandbox



A separate environment, isolated from your production data

To test Polar or work on your integration without worrying about actual money processing or breaking your live organization, you can use our [sandbox environment](https://sandbox.polar.sh/start).

It's a dedicated server, completely isolated from the production instance where you can do all the experiments you want.

<Note>
  **Why a dedicated environment instead of a test mode?**

  Since we're dealing with money and need to keep track of all movements to assure our Merchant of Record service, we found it safer to isolate live data from test data so it never interferes. Besides, it allows you to create an unlimited number of account and organization to test lot of different scenarios. Consider it as your own development server!
</Note>

## Get started

You can access the sandbox environment directly on [sandbox.polar.sh](https://sandbox.polar.sh/start) or by clicking on `Go to sandbox` from the organization switcher.

You'll then need to create a dedicated user account and organization, the same way described in our [Quick Start guide](/introduction).

### Testing payments

The sandbox environment allows you to experience the complete customer funnel, including checkout. You can perform test payments using Stripe's [test card numbers](https://docs.stripe.com/testing#cards).

The easiest one to test a successful payment is to use the following card number with a future expiration date and random CVC:

```
4242 4242 4242 4242
```

## API and SDK

To make requests to our [API](/api-reference), all you need to do is to switch the base URL from `https://api.polar.sh` to `https://sandbox-api.polar.sh`. You'll also need to create an access token in the **sandbox environment**, the access token created in the production environment can't be used in the sandbox.

Our official SDK supports the sandbox environment through a dedicated parameter.

<CodeGroup>
  ```ts TypeScript theme={null}
  const polar = new Polar({
    server: 'sandbox',
    accessToken: process.env['POLAR_ACCESS_TOKEN'] ?? '',
  })
  ```

  ```py Python theme={null}
  s = Polar(
      server="sandbox",
      access_token="<YOUR_BEARER_TOKEN_HERE>",
  )
  ```

  ```go Go theme={null}
    s := polargo.New(
    	polargo.WithServer("sandbox"),
    	polargo.WithSecurity(os.Getenv("POLAR_ACCESS_TOKEN")),
    )
  ```

  ```php PHP theme={null}
  $sdk = Polar\Polar::builder()
      ->setServer('sandbox')
      ->setSecurity(
          '<YOUR_BEARER_TOKEN_HERE>'
      )
      ->build();
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Limitations

The limitations listed below only apply to sandbox and doesn't reflect the behavior in production.

* Subscriptions created in sandbox are automatically canceled **90 days after their creation**.

    Go to your Polar Organization Settings, create an Organization Access Token, and add it to the environment variables of your application.

    ```bash .env theme={null}
    POLAR_ACCESS_TOKEN=...
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure BetterAuth Server">
    The Polar plugin comes with it's own set of plugins to add functionality to your stack:

    * **checkout** - Enable seamless checkout integration
    * **portal** - Make it possible for your customers to manage their orders, subscriptions & benefits
    * **usage** - List customer meters & ingest events for Usage Based Billing
    * **webhooks** - Listen for relevant Polar webhooks

    ```typescript icon="square-js" BetterAuth Server with Polar Example theme={null}
    import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
    import { polar, checkout, portal, usage, webhooks } from "@polar-sh/better-auth"; // [!code ++]
    import { Polar } from "@polar-sh/sdk"; // [!code ++]

    const polarClient = new Polar({ // [!code ++]
        accessToken: process.env.POLAR_ACCESS_TOKEN, // [!code ++]
        // Use 'sandbox' if you're using the Polar Sandbox environment
        // Remember that access tokens, products, etc. are completely separated between environments.
        // Access tokens obtained in Production are for instance not usable in the Sandbox environment.
        server: 'sandbox' // [!code ++]
    }); // [!code ++]

    const auth = betterAuth({
        // ... Better Auth config
        plugins: [
            polar({ // [!code ++]
                client: polarClient, // [!code ++]
                createCustomerOnSignUp: true, // [!code ++]
                use: [ // [!code ++]
                    checkout({ // [!code ++]
                        products: [ // [!code ++]
                            { // [!code ++]
                                productId: "123-456-789", // ID of Product from Polar Dashboard // [!code ++]

                        onPayload: (payload) => // Catch-all for all events // [!code ++]
                    }) // [!code ++]
                ], // [!code ++]
            }) // [!code ++]
        ]
    });
    ```

    #### Polar Plugin Configuration Options

    ```typescript  theme={null}
    // ...

    const auth = betterAuth({
      // ... Better Auth config
      plugins: [
        polar({
          client: polarClient, // [!code ++]
          createCustomerOnSignUp: true, // [!code ++]
          getCustomerCreateParams: ({ user }, request) => ({ // [!code ++]
            metadata: { // [!code ++]
              myCustomProperty: 123, // [!code ++]
            }, // [!code ++]
          }), // [!code ++]
          use: [ // [!code ++]
            // This is where you add Polar plugins // [!code ++]
          ], // [!code ++]
        }),
      ],
    });
    ```

    * `client` (required): Polar SDK client instance
    * `createCustomerOnSignUp` (optional): Automatically create a Polar customer when a user signs up
    * `getCustomerCreateParams` (optional): Custom function to provide additional customer creation metadata
    * `use` (optional): Array of Polar plugins to enable specific functionality (checkout, portal, usage, and webhooks)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure BetterAuth Client">
    You will be using the BetterAuth Client to interact with the Polar functionalities.

    ```typescript icon="square-js" BetterAuth Client with Polar Example theme={null}
    import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/react";
    import { polarClient } from "@polar-sh/better-auth"; // [!code ++]
    import { organizationClient } from "better-auth/client/plugins"; // [!code ++]

    // All Polar plugins, etc. should be attached to BetterAuth server
    export const authClient = createAuthClient({ // [!code ++]
      plugins: [polarClient()], // [!code ++]
    }); // [!code ++]
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Automatic Customer creation on signup

Enable the `createCustomerOnSignUp` [Polar plugin configuration option](#polar-plugin-configuration-options) to automatically create a new Polar Customer when a new User is added in the BetterAuth database.

All new customers are created with an associated `externalId`, i.e. the ID of your User in the Database. This skips any Polar to User mapping in your database.

## Sync Customer deletion

To add user deletion logic with external Polar customer deletion in BetterAuth, extend the user config of your betterAuth setup with the deleteUser option and an afterDelete hook. Here’s how to integrate this alongside your Polar plugin and automatic customer creation:

```typescript icon="square-js" Customer Deletion Example theme={null}
const auth = betterAuth({
  user: {
    // [!code ++]
    deleteUser: {
      // [!code ++]
      enabled: true, // [!code ++]
      afterDelete: async (user, request) => {
        // [!code ++]
        await polar.customers.deleteExternal({
          // [!code ++]
          externalId: user.id, // [!code ++]
        }); // [!code ++]
      }, // [!code ++]
    }, // [!code ++]
  }, // [!code ++]
});
```

## Checkout Plugin

[Source code](https://github.com/polarsource/polar-adapters/blob/main/packages/polar-betterauth/src/plugins/checkout.ts)

To support [checkouts](/features/checkout/links) in your app, you would pass the `checkout` plugin in the `use` property.

The checkout plugin accepts the following configuration options:

* **`products`** (optional): An array of product mappings or a function that returns them asynchronously. Each mapping contains a `productId` and a `slug` that allows you to reference products by a friendly slug instead of their full ID.
* **`successUrl`** (optional): The relative URL where customers will be redirected after a successful checkout completion. You can use the `{CHECKOUT_ID}` placeholder in the URL to include the checkout session ID in the redirect.
* **`returnUrl`** (optional): An optional URL which renders a back-button in the Checkout.
* **`authenticatedUsersOnly`** (optional): A boolean flag that controls whether checkout sessions require user authentication. When set to `true`, only authenticated users can initiate checkouts and the customer information will be automatically associated with the authenticated user. When `false`, anonymous checkouts are allowed.
* **`theme`** (optional): A string that can be used to enforce the theme of the checkout page. Can be either `light` or `dark`.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Use Checkout Plugin">
    Update the `use` property of the Polar plugin for BetterAuth client to have the `checkout` plugin.

    ```typescript icon="square-js" Checkout Plugin Example theme={null}
    import {
      polar,
      checkout // [!code ++]
    } from "@polar-sh/better-auth";

    const auth = betterAuth({
        // ... Better Auth config
        plugins: [
            polar({
                ...
                use: [
                    checkout({ // [!code ++]
                        // Optional field - will make it possible to pass a slug to checkout instead of Product ID
                        products: [ { productId: "123-456-789", slug: "pro" } ], // [!code ++]
                        // Relative URL to return to when checkout is successfully completed
                        successUrl: "/success?checkout_id={CHECKOUT_ID}", // [!code ++]
                        // Whether you want to allow unauthenticated checkout sessions or not
                        authenticatedUsersOnly: true, // [!code ++]
                        // An optional URL which renders a back-button in the Checkout
                        returnUrl: "https://myapp.com" // [!code ++]
                    }) // [!code ++]
                ],
            })
        ]
    });
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create checkouts using BetterAuth client">
    When the `checkout` plugin is passed, you are then able to initialize Checkout Sessions using the `checkout` method on the BetterAuth client. This will redirect the user to the product's checkout link.

    The `checkout` method accepts the following properties:

    * **`products`** (optional): An array of Polar Product IDs.
    * **`slug`** (optional): A string that can be used as a reference to the `products` defined in the Checkout config
    * **`referenceId`** (optional): An identifier that will be saved in the metadata of the checkout, order & subscription object

    ```typescript icon="square-js" BetterAuth Checkout with Polar Example theme={null}
    await authClient.checkout({
      // Polar Product IDs
      products: ["e651f46d-ac20-4f26-b769-ad088b123df2"], // [!code ++]
      // OR
      // if "products" in passed in the checkout plugin's config, you may pass the slug
      // slug: "pro", // [!code ++]
    });
    ```

    This plugin supports the Organization plugin. If you pass the organization ID to the Checkout referenceId, you will be able to keep track of purchases made from organization members.

    ```typescript icon="square-js" BetterAuth Checkout with Polar Organization Example theme={null}
    const organizationId = (await authClient.organization.list())?.data?.[0]?.id,

    await authClient.checkout({
        // Any Polar Product ID can be passed here
        products: ["e651f46d-ac20-4f26-b769-ad088b123df2"],
        // Or, if you setup "products" in the Checkout Config, you can pass the slug
        slug: 'pro',
        // Reference ID will be saved as `referenceId` in the metadata of the checkout, order & subscription object
        referenceId: organizationId
    });
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Usage Plugin

[Source code](https://github.com/polarsource/polar-adapters/blob/main/packages/polar-betterauth/src/plugins/usage.ts)

A plugin for Usage Based Billing that allows you to [ingest events](#event-ingestion) from your application and list the [authenticated user's Usage Meter](#customer-meters).

To enable [usage based billing](/integrate/sdk/adapters/better-auth) in your app, you would pass the `usage` plugin in the `use` property.

```typescript icon="square-js" Usage Plugin Example theme={null}
import {
  polar, checkout, portal,
  usage // [!code ++]
} from "@polar-sh/better-auth";

const auth = betterAuth({
    // ... Better Auth config
    plugins: [
        polar({
            ...
            use: [
                checkout(...),
                portal(),
                usage() // [!code ++]
            ],
        })
    ]
});
```

### 1. Event Ingestion

Polar's Usage Based Billing builds entirely on event ingestion. Ingest events from your application, create Meters to represent that usage, and add metered prices to Products to charge for it.

The `ingestion` method of the `usage` plugin accepts the following parameters:

* `event` (string): The name of the event to ingest. For example, `ai_usage`, `video_streamed` or `file_uploaded`.

* `metadata` (object): A record containing key-value pairs that provide additional context about the event. Values can be strings, numbers, or booleans. This is useful for storing information that can be used to filter the events or compute the actual usage. For example, you can store the duration of the video streamed or the size of the file uploaded.

<Info>
  The authenticated user is automatically associated with the ingested event.
</Info>

```typescript icon="square-js" Event Ingestion with Usage Plugin Example theme={null}
const { data: ingested } = await authClient.usage.ingestion({
  event: "file-uploads",
  metadata: {
    uploadedFiles: 12,
  },
});
```

### 2. Customer Meters

A method to list the authenticated user's Usage Meters (aka Customer Meters). A Customer Meter contains all the information about their consumption on your defined meters.

The `meters` method of the `usage` plugin accepts the following parameters:

* `page` (number): The page number for pagination (starts from 1).

* `limit` (number): The maximum number of meters to return per page.

```typescript icon="square-js" Customer Meters with Usage Plugin Example theme={null}
const { data: customerMeters } = await authClient.usage.meters.list({
  query: {
    page: 1,
    limit: 10,
  },
});
```

The `meters` method returns the following fields in the response object:

* **Customer Information**: Details about the authenticated customer
* **Meter Information**: Configuration and settings of the usage meter
* **Customer Meter Information**:
  * **Consumed Units**: Total units consumed by the customer
  * **Credited Units**: Total units credited to the customer
  * **Balance**: The balance of the meter, i.e. the difference between credited and consumed units.

## Webhooks Plugin

[Source code](https://github.com/polarsource/polar-adapters/blob/main/packages/polar-betterauth/src/plugins/webhooks.ts)

The `webhooks` plugin can be used to capture incoming events from your Polar organization.

To set up the Polar `webhooks` plugin with the BetterAuth client, follow the steps below:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure Webhook Endpoints in Polar">
    Configure a Webhook endpoint in your Polar Organization Settings page by following [this guide](/integrate/webhooks/endpoints). Webhook endpoint is configured at `/api/auth/polar/webhooks`.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add the Webhook Secret">
    Add the obtained webhook secret to your application environment as an environment variable (to be used as `process.env.POLAR_WEBHOOK_SECRET`):

    ```bash .env theme={null}
    POLAR_WEBHOOK_SECRET="..."
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Use Webhooks Plugin in BetterAuth client">
    Pass the `webhooks` plugin in the `use` property.

    ```typescript icon="square-js" Webhooks Plugin Example theme={null}
    import {
      polar,
      webhooks // [!code ++]
    } from "@polar-sh/better-auth";

    const auth = betterAuth({
        // ... Better Auth config
        plugins: [
            polar({
                ...
                use: [
                    webhooks({ // [!code ++]
                        secret: process.env.POLAR_WEBHOOK_SECRET, // [!code ++]
                        onCustomerStateChanged: (payload) => // Triggered when anything regarding a customer changes // [!code ++]
                        onOrderPaid: (payload) => // Triggered when an order was paid (purchase, subscription renewal, etc.) // [!code ++]
                        ...  // Over 25 granular webhook handlers // [!code ++]
                        onPayload: (payload) => // Catch-all for all events // [!code ++]
                    }) // [!code ++]
                ],
            })
        ]
    });
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

The `webhooks` plugin allows you to invoke handlers for all Polar webhook events:

* `onPayload` - Catch-all handler for any incoming Webhook event
* `onCheckoutCreated` - Triggered when a checkout is created
* `onCheckoutUpdated` - Triggered when a checkout is updated
* `onOrderCreated` - Triggered when an order is created
* `onOrderPaid` - Triggered when an order is paid
* `onOrderRefunded` - Triggered when an order is refunded
* `onRefundCreated` - Triggered when a refund is created
* `onRefundUpdated` - Triggered when a refund is updated
* `onSubscriptionCreated` - Triggered when a subscription is created
* `onSubscriptionUpdated` - Triggered when a subscription is updated
* `onSubscriptionActive` - Triggered when a subscription becomes active
* `onSubscriptionCanceled` - Triggered when a subscription is canceled
* `onSubscriptionRevoked` - Triggered when a subscription is revoked
* `onSubscriptionUncanceled` - Triggered when a subscription cancellation is reversed
* `onProductCreated` - Triggered when a product is created
* `onProductUpdated` - Triggered when a product is updated
* `onOrganizationUpdated` - Triggered when an organization is updated
* `onBenefitCreated` - Triggered when a benefit is created
* `onBenefitUpdated` - Triggered when a benefit is updated
* `onBenefitGrantCreated` - Triggered when a benefit grant is created
* `onBenefitGrantUpdated` - Triggered when a benefit grant is updated
* `onBenefitGrantRevoked` - Triggered when a benefit grant is revoked
* `onCustomerCreated` - Triggered when a customer is created
* `onCustomerUpdated` - Triggered when a customer is updated
* `onCustomerDeleted` - Triggered when a customer is deleted
* `onCustomerStateChanged` - Triggered when a customer state changes

## Portal Plugin

[Source code](https://github.com/polarsource/polar-adapters/blob/main/packages/polar-betterauth/src/plugins/portal.ts)

A plugin which enables customer management of their purchases, orders and subscriptions.

```typescript icon="square-js" Portal Plugin Example theme={null}
import {
  polar, checkout,
  portal // [!code ++]
} from "@polar-sh/better-auth";

const auth = betterAuth({
    // ... Better Auth config
    plugins: [
        polar({
            ...
            use: [
                checkout(...),
                portal({
                  returnUrl: "https://myapp.com", // An optional URL which renders a back-button in the Customer Portal
                }) // [!code ++]
            ],
        })
    ]
});
```

The `portal` plugin gives the BetterAuth Client a set of customer management methods, scoped under `authClient.customer` object.

### 1. Customer Portal Management

The following method will redirect the user to the Polar Customer Portal, where they can see their orders, purchases, subscriptions, benefits, etc.

```typescript icon="square-js" Open Customer Portal Example theme={null}
await authClient.customer.portal();
```

### 2. Customer State

The portal plugin also adds a convenient method to retrieve the Customer State.

```typescript icon="square-js" Retrieve Customer State Example theme={null}
const { data: customerState } = await authClient.customer.state();
```

The customer state object contains:

* All the data about the customer.
* The list of their active subscriptions.
  <Note>
    This does not include subscriptions done by a parent organization. See the
    subscription list-method below for more information.
  </Note>
* The list of their granted benefits.
* The list of their active meters, with their current balance.

Using the customer state object, you can determine whether to provision access for the user to your service.

Learn more about the Polar Customer State [in the Polar Docs](https://polar.sh/docs/integrate/customer-state).

### 3. Benefits, Orders & Subscriptions

The portal plugin adds the following 3 convenient methods for listing benefits, orders & subscriptions relevant to the authenticated user/customer.

#### 3.1 Benefits

This method only lists granted benefits for the authenticated user/customer.

```typescript icon="square-js" List User Benefits Example theme={null}
const { data: benefits } = await authClient.customer.benefits.list({
  query: {
    page: 1,
    limit: 10,
  },
});
```

#### 3.2 Orders

This method lists orders like purchases and subscription renewals for the authenticated user/customer.

```typescript icon="square-js" List User Orders Example theme={null}
const { data: orders } = await authClient.customer.orders.list({
  query: {
    page: 1,
    limit: 10,
    productBillingType: "one_time", // or 'recurring'
  },
});
```

Using the Organization ID as the `referenceId` you can retrieve all the subscriptions associated with that organization (instead of the user).

To figure out if a user should have access, pass the user's organization ID to see if there is an active subscription for that organization.

```typescript icon="square-js" List Organization Subscriptions Example theme={null}
const organizationId = (await authClient.organization.list())?.data?.[0]?.id,

const { data: subscriptions } = await authClient.customer.orders.list({
    query: {
	    page: 1,
		limit: 10,
		active: true,
        referenceId: organizationId
    },
});

const userShouldHaveAccess = subscriptions.some(
    sub => // Your logic to check subscription product or whatever.
)
```

#### 3.3 Subscriptions

This method lists the subscriptions associated with authenticated user/customer.

```typescript icon="square-js" List User Subscriptions Example theme={null}
const { data: subscriptions } = await authClient.customer.subscriptions.list({
  query: {
    page: 1,
    limit: 10,
    active: true,
  },
});
```

<Danger>
  This will not return subscriptions made by a parent organization to the
  authenticated user.
</Danger>

import { Elysia } from "elysia";
import { Checkout } from "@polar-sh/elysia";

const app = new Elysia();

app.get(
  "/checkout",
  Checkout({
    accessToken: "xxx", // Or set an environment variable to POLAR_ACCESS_TOKEN
    successUrl: process.env.SUCCESS_URL,
    returnUrl: "https://myapp.com", // An optional URL which renders a back-button in the Checkout
    server: "sandbox", // Use sandbox if you're testing Polar - omit the parameter or pass 'production' otherwise
    theme: "dark", // Enforces the theme - System-preferred theme will be set if left omitted
  })
);
```

#### Query Params

Pass query params to this route.

* products `?products=123`
* customerId (optional) `?products=123&customerId=xxx`

app.get(
  "/portal",
  CustomerPortal({
    accessToken: "xxx", // Or set an environment variable to POLAR_ACCESS_TOKEN
    getCustomerId: (event) => "", // Function to resolve a Polar Customer ID
    returnUrl: "https://myapp.com", // An optional URL which renders a back-button in the Customer Portal
    server: "sandbox", // Use sandbox if you're testing Polar - omit the parameter or pass 'production' otherwise
  })
);
```

### Webhooks

A simple utility which resolves incoming webhook payloads by signing the webhook secret properly.

```typescript icon="square-js"  theme={null}

# Laravel
Source: https://polar.sh/docs/integrate/sdk/adapters/laravel

Payments and Checkouts made dead simple with Laravel

Seamlessly integrate Polar.sh subscriptions and payments into your Laravel application. This package provides an elegant way to handle subscriptions, manage recurring payments, and interact with Polar's API. With built-in support for webhooks, subscription management, and a fluent API, you can focus on building your application while we handle the complexities of subscription billing.

<Note>
  This provider is not maintained or officially supported by Polar. Use at your own discretion. If you have questions about the provider, please contact the project maintainer.
</Note>

## Installation

**Step 1:** You can install the package via composer:

```bash Terminal theme={null}
composer require danestves/laravel-polar
```

**Step 2:** Run `:install`:

```bash Terminal theme={null}
php artisan polar:install
```

This will publish the config, migrations and views, and ask to run the migrations.

Or publish and run the migrations individually:

```bash Terminal theme={null}
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="polar-migrations"
```

```bash Terminal theme={null}
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="polar-config"
```

```bash Terminal theme={null}
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="polar-views"
```

```bash Terminal theme={null}
php artisan migrate
```

This is the contents of the published config file:

```php  theme={null}
<?php

```

## Usage

### Access Token

Configure your access token. Create a new token in the Polar Dashboard > Settings > Developers and paste it in the `.env` file.

* [https://sandbox.polar.sh/dashboard/ORG\_SLUG/settings](https://sandbox.polar.sh/dashboard/ORG_SLUG/settings) (Sandbox)
* [https://polar.sh/dashboard/ORG\_SLUG/settings](https://polar.sh/dashboard/ORG_SLUG/settings) (Production)

```bash Terminal theme={null}
POLAR_ACCESS_TOKEN="<your_access_token>"
```

### Webhook Secret

Configure your webhook secret. Create a new webhook in the Polar Dashboard > Settings > Webhooks.

* [https://sandbox.polar.sh/dashboard/ORG\_SLUG/settings/webhooks](https://sandbox.polar.sh/dashboard/ORG_SLUG/settings/webhooks) (Sandbox)
* [https://polar.sh/dashboard/ORG\_SLUG/settings/webhooks](https://polar.sh/dashboard/ORG_SLUG/settings/webhooks) (Production)

Configure the webhook for the following events that this pacckage supports:

* `order.created`
* `order.updated`
* `subscription.created`
* `subscription.updated`
* `subscription.active`
* `subscription.canceled`
* `subscription.revoked`
* `benefit_grant.created`
* `benefit_grant.updated`
* `benefit_grant.revoked`

```bash Terminal theme={null}
POLAR_WEBHOOK_SECRET="<your_webhook_secret>"
```

### Billable Trait

Let’s make sure everything’s ready for your customers to checkout smoothly. 🛒

First, we’ll need to set up a model to handle billing—don’t worry, it’s super simple! In most cases, this will be your app’s User model. Just add the Billable trait to your model like this (you’ll import it from the package first, of course):

```php  theme={null}
use Danestves\LaravelPolar\Billable;

class User extends Authenticatable
{
    use Billable;
}
```

Now the user model will have access to the methods provided by the package. You can make any model billable by adding the trait to it, not just the User model.

### Polar Script

Polar includes a JavaScript script that you can use to initialize the [Polar Embedded Checkout](https://polar.sh/docs/features/checkout/embed). If you going to use this functionality, you can use the `@polarEmbedScript` directive to include the script in your views inside the `<head>` tag.

```blade  theme={null}
<head>
    ...

    @polarEmbedScript
</head>
```

### Webhooks

This package includes a webhook handler that will handle the webhooks from Polar.

#### Webhooks & CSRF Protection

Incoming webhooks should not be affected by [CSRF protection](https://laravel.com/docs/csrf). To prevent this, add your webhook path to the except list of your `App\Http\Middleware\VerifyCsrfToken` middleware:

```php  theme={null}
protected $except = [
    'polar/*',
];
```

Or if you're using Laravel v11 and up, you should exclude `polar/*` in your application's `bootstrap/app.php` file:

```php  theme={null}
->withMiddleware(function (Middleware $middleware) {
    $middleware->validateCsrfTokens(except: [
        'polar/*',
    ]);
})
```

### Commands

This package includes a list of commands that you can use to retrieve information about your Polar account.

| Command                      | Description                                |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `php artisan polar:products` | List all available products with their ids |

### Checkouts

#### Single Payments

To create a checkout to show only a single payment, pass a single items to the array of products when creating the checkout.

```php  theme={null}
use Illuminate\Http\Request;

Route::get('/subscribe', function (Request $request) {
    return $request->user()->checkout(['product_id_123']);
});
```

If you want to show multiple products that the user can choose from, you can pass an array of product ids to the `checkout` method.

```php  theme={null}
use Illuminate\Http\Request;

Route::get('/subscribe', function (Request $request) {
    return $request->user()->checkout(['product_id_123', 'product_id_456']);
});
```

This could be useful if you want to offer monthly, yearly, and lifetime plans for example.

> \[!NOTE]
> If you are requesting the checkout a lot of times we recommend you to cache the URL returned by the `checkout` method.

#### Custom Price

You can override the price of a product using the `charge` method.

```php  theme={null}
use Illuminate\Http\Request;

Route::get('/subscribe', function (Request $request) {
    return $request->user()->charge(1000, ['product_id_123']);
});
```

#### Embedded Checkout

Instead of redirecting the user you can create the checkout link, pass it to the page and use our blade component:

```php  theme={null}
use Illuminate\Http\Request;

Route::get('/billing', function (Request $request) {
    $checkout = $request->user()->checkout(['product_id_123']);

    return view('billing', ['checkout' => $checkout]);
});
```

Now we can use the button like this:

```blade  theme={null}
<x-polar-button :checkout="$checkout" />
```

The component accepts the normal props that a link element accepts. You can change the theme of the embedded checkout by using the following prop:

```blade  theme={null}
<x-polar-button :checkout="$checkout" data-polar-checkout-theme="dark" />
```

It defaults to light theme, so you only need to pass the prop if you want to change it.

### Prefill Customer Information

You can override the user data using the following methods in your models provided by the `Billable` trait.

```php  theme={null}
public function polarName(): ?string; // default: $model->name
public function polarEmail(): ?string; // default: $model->email
```

### Redirects After Purchase

You can redirect the user to a custom page after the purchase using the `withSuccessUrl` method:

```php  theme={null}
$request->user()->checkout('variant-id')
    ->withSuccessUrl(url('/success'));
```

You can also add the `checkout_id={CHECKOUT_ID}` query parameter to the URL to retrieve the checkout session id:

```php  theme={null}
$request->user()->checkout('variant-id')
    ->withSuccessUrl(url('/success?checkout_id={CHECKOUT_ID}'));
```

### Custom metadata and customer metadata

You can add custom metadata to the checkout session using the `withMetadata` method:

```php  theme={null}
$request->user()->checkout('variant-id')
    ->withMetadata(['key' => 'value']);
```

You can also add customer metadata to the checkout session using the `withCustomerMetadata` method:

```php  theme={null}
$request->user()->checkout('variant-id')
    ->withCustomerMetadata(['key' => 'value']);
```

These will then be available in the relevant webhooks for you.

#### Reserved Keywords

When working with custom data, this library has a few reserved terms.

* `billable_id`
* `billable_type`
* `subscription_type`

Using any of these will result in an exception being thrown.

### Customers

#### Customer Portal

Customers can update their personal information (e.g., name, email address) by accessing their [self-service customer portal](https://polar.sh/docs/features/customer-portal). To redirect customers to this portal, call the `redirectToCustomerPortal()` method on your billable model (e.g., the User model).

```php  theme={null}
use Illuminate\Http\Request;

Route::get('/customer-portal', function (Request $request) {
    return $request->user()->redirectToCustomerPortal();
});
```

Optionally, you can obtain the signed customer portal URL directly:

```php  theme={null}
$url = $user->customerPortalUrl();
```

### Orders

#### Retrieving Orders

You can retrieve orders by using the `orders` relationship on the billable model:

```blade  theme={null}
<table>
    @foreach ($user->orders as $order)
        <td>{{ $order->ordered_at->toFormattedDateString() }}</td>
        <td>{{ $order->polar_id }}</td>
        <td>{{ $order->amount }}</td>
        <td>{{ $order->tax_amount }}</td>
        <td>{{ $order->refunded_amount }}</td>
        <td>{{ $order->refunded_tax_amount }}</td>
        <td>{{ $order->currency }}</td>
        <!-- Add more columns as needed -->
    @endforeach
</table>
```

#### Check order status

You can check the status of an order by using the `status` attribute:

```php  theme={null}
$order->status;
```

Or you can use some of the helper methods offers by the `Order` model:

```php  theme={null}
$order->paid();
```

Aside from that, you can run two other checks: refunded, and partially refunded. If the order is refunded, you can utilize the refunded\_at timestamp:

```blade  theme={null}
@if ($order->refunded())
    Order {{ $order->polar_id }} was refunded on {{ $order->refunded_at->toFormattedDateString() }}
@endif
```

You may also see if an order was for a certain product:

```php  theme={null}
if ($order->hasProduct('product_id_123')) {
    // ...
}
```

Or for an specific price:

```php  theme={null}
if ($order->hasPrice('price_id_123')) {
    // ...
}
```

Furthermore, you can check if a consumer has purchased a specific product:

```php  theme={null}
if ($user->hasPurchasedProduct('product_id_123')) {
    // ...
}
```

Or for an specific price:

```php  theme={null}
if ($user->hasPurchasedPrice('price_id_123')) {
    // ...
}
```

### Subscriptions

#### Creating Subscriptions

Starting a subscription is simple. For this, we require our product's variant id. Copy the product id and start a new subscription checkout using your billable model:

```php  theme={null}
use Illuminate\Http\Request;

Route::get('/subscribe', function (Request $request) {
    return $request->user()->subscribe('product_id_123');
});
```

When a customer completes their checkout, the incoming `SubscriptionCreated` event webhook connects it to your billable model in the database. You may then get the subscription from your billable model:

```php  theme={null}
$subscription = $user->subscription();
```

#### Checking Subscription Status

Once a consumer has subscribed to your services, you can use a variety of methods to check on the status of their subscription. The most basic example is to check if a customer has a valid subscription.

```php  theme={null}
if ($user->subscribed()) {
    // ...
}
```

You can utilize this in a variety of locations in your app, such as middleware, rules, and so on, to provide services. To determine whether an individual subscription is valid, you can use the `valid` method:

```php  theme={null}
if ($user->subscription()->valid()) {
    // ...
}
```

This method, like the subscribed method, returns true if your membership is active, on trial, past due, or cancelled during its grace period.

You may also check if a subscription is for a certain product:

```php  theme={null}
if ($user->subscription()->hasProduct('product_id_123')) {
    // ...
}
```

Or for a certain price:

```php  theme={null}
if ($user->subscription()->hasPrice('price_id_123')) {
    // ...
}
```

If you wish to check if a subscription is on a specific price while being valid, you can use:

```php  theme={null}
if ($user->subscribedToPrice('price_id_123')) {
    // ...
}
```

Alternatively, if you use different [subscription types](#multiple-subscriptions), you can pass a type as an additional parameter:

```php  theme={null}
if ($user->subscribed('swimming')) {
    // ...
}

if ($user->subscribedToPrice('price_id_123', 'swimming')) {
    // ...
}
```

#### Cancelled Status

To see if a user has cancelled their subscription, you can use the cancelled method:

```php  theme={null}
if ($user->subscription()->cancelled()) {
    // ...
}
```

When they are in their grace period, you can utilize the `onGracePeriod` check.

```php  theme={null}
if ($user->subscription()->onGracePeriod()) {
    // ...
}
```

#### Past Due Status

If a recurring payment fails, the subscription will become past due. This indicates that the subscription is still valid, but your customer's payments will be retried in two weeks.

```php  theme={null}
if ($user->subscription()->pastDue()) {
    // ...
}
```

#### Subscription Scopes

There are several subscription scopes available for querying subscriptions in specific states:

```php  theme={null}
// Get all active subscriptions...
$subscriptions = Subscription::query()->active()->get();

// Get all of the cancelled subscriptions for a specific user...
$subscriptions = $user->subscriptions()->cancelled()->get();
```

Here's all available scopes:

```php  theme={null}
Subscription::query()->incomplete();
Subscription::query()->incompleteExpired();
Subscription::query()->onTrial();
Subscription::query()->active();
Subscription::query()->pastDue();
Subscription::query()->unpaid();
Subscription::query()->cancelled();
```

#### Changing Plans

When a consumer is on a monthly plan, they may desire to upgrade to a better plan, alter their payments to an annual plan, or drop to a lower-cost plan. In these cases, you can allow them to swap plans by giving a different product id to the `swap` method:

```php  theme={null}
use App\Models\User;

$user = User::find(1);

$user->subscription()->swap('product_id_123');
```

This will change the customer's subscription plan, however billing will not occur until the next payment cycle. If you want to immediately invoice the customer, you can use the `swapAndInvoice` method instead.

```php  theme={null}
$user = User::find(1);

$user->subscription()->swapAndInvoice('product_id_123');
```

#### Multiple Subscriptions

In certain situations, you may wish to allow your consumer to subscribe to numerous subscription kinds. For example, a gym may provide a swimming and weight lifting subscription. You can let your customers subscribe to one or both.

To handle the various subscriptions, you can offer a type of subscription as the second argument when creating a new one:

```php  theme={null}
$user = User::find(1);

$checkout = $user->subscribe('product_id_123', 'swimming');
```

You can now always refer to this specific subscription type by passing the type argument when getting it:

```php  theme={null}
$user = User::find(1);

// Retrieve the swimming subscription type...
$subscription = $user->subscription('swimming');

// Swap plans for the gym subscription type...
$user->subscription('gym')->swap('product_id_123');

// Cancel the swimming subscription...
$user->subscription('swimming')->cancel();
```

#### Cancelling Subscriptions

To cancel a subscription, call the `cancel` method.

```php  theme={null}
$user = User::find(1);

$user->subscription()->cancel();
```

This will cause your subscription to be cancelled. If you cancel your subscription in the middle of the cycle, it will enter a grace period, and the ends\_at column will be updated. The customer will continue to have access to the services offered for the duration of the period. You may check the grace period by calling the `onGracePeriod` method:

```php  theme={null}
if ($user->subscription()->onGracePeriod()) {
    // ...
}
```

Polar does not offer immediate cancellation. To resume a subscription while it is still in its grace period, use the resume method.

```php  theme={null}
$user->subscription()->resume();
```

When a cancelled subscription approaches the end of its grace period, it becomes expired and cannot be resumed.

### Handling Webhooks

Polar can send webhooks to your app, allowing you to react. By default, this package handles the majority of the work for you. If you have properly configured webhooks, it will listen for incoming events and update your database accordingly. We recommend activating all event kinds so you may easily upgrade in the future.

#### Webhook Events

* `Danestves\LaravelPolar\Events\BenefitGrantCreated`
* `Danestves\LaravelPolar\Events\BenefitGrantUpdated`
* `Danestves\LaravelPolar\Events\BenefitGrantRevoked`
* `Danestves\LaravelPolar\Events\OrderCreated`
* `Danestves\LaravelPolar\Events\OrderRefunded`
* `Danestves\LaravelPolar\Events\SubscriptionActive`
* `Danestves\LaravelPolar\Events\SubscriptionCanceled`
* `Danestves\LaravelPolar\Events\SubscriptionCreated`
* `Danestves\LaravelPolar\Events\SubscriptionRevoked`
* `Danestves\LaravelPolar\Events\SubscriptionUpdated`

Each of these events has a billable `$model` object and an event `$payload`. The subscription events also include the `$subscription` object. These can be accessed via the public properties.

If you wish to respond to these events, you must establish listeners for them. For example, you may wish to react when a subscription is updated.

```php  theme={null}
<?php

namespace App\Listeners;

use Danestves\LaravelPolar\Events\WebhookHandled;

class PolarEventListener
{
    /**
     * Handle received Polar webhooks.
     */
    public function handle(WebhookHandled $event): void
    {
        if ($event->payload['type'] === 'subscription.updated') {
            // Handle the incoming event...
        }
    }
}
```

The [Polar documentation](https://polar.sh/docs/integrate/webhooks/events) includes an example payload.

Laravel v11 and up will automatically discover the listener. If you're using Laravel v10 or lower, you should configure it in your app's `EventServiceProvider`:

```php  theme={null}
<?php

namespace App\Providers;

use App\Listeners\PolarEventListener;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Support\Providers\EventServiceProvider as ServiceProvider;
use Danestves\LaravelPolar\Events\WebhookHandled;

class EventServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider
{
    protected $listen = [
        WebhookHandled::class => [
            PolarEventListener::class,
        ],
    ];
}
```

composer test
```

## Checkout

Create a Checkout handler which takes care of redirections.

```typescript  theme={null}
import { Checkout } from "@polar-sh/supabase";

export const GET = Checkout({
  accessToken: POLAR_ACCESS_TOKEN,
  successUrl: POLAR_SUCCESS_URL,
  returnUrl: "https://myapp.com", // An optional URL which renders a back-button in the Checkout
  server: "sandbox", // Use sandbox if you're testing Polar - omit the parameter or pass 'production' otherwise
  theme: "dark", // Enforces the theme - System-preferred theme will be set if left omitted
});
```

### Query Params

Pass query params to this route.

* products `?products=123`
* customerId (optional) `?products=123&customerId=xxx`
* customerExternalId (optional) `?products=123&customerExternalId=xxx`
* customerEmail (optional) `?products=123&customerEmail=janedoe@gmail.com`
* customerName (optional) `?products=123&customerName=Jane`
* metadata (optional) `URL-Encoded JSON string`

## Customer Portal

Create a customer portal where your customer can view orders and subscriptions.

```typescript  theme={null}
import { CustomerPortal } from "@polar-sh/supabase";

export const GET = CustomerPortal({
  accessToken: POLAR_ACCESS_TOKEN,
  getCustomerId: (event) => "", // Function to resolve a Polar Customer ID
  returnUrl: "https://myapp.com", // An optional URL which renders a back-button in the Customer Portal
  server: "sandbox", // Use sandbox if you're testing Polar - omit the parameter or pass 'production' otherwise
});
```

## Webhooks

A simple utility which resolves incoming webhook payloads by signing the webhook secret properly.

```typescript  theme={null}
import { Webhooks } from '@polar-sh/supabase';

export const POST = Webhooks({
  webhookSecret: POLAR_WEBHOOK_SECRET,
  onPayload: async (payload) => /** Handle payload */,
})
```

### Payload Handlers

The Webhook handler also supports granular handlers for easy integration.

* `onPayload` - Catch-all handler for any incoming Webhook event
* `onCheckoutCreated` - Triggered when a checkout is created
* `onCheckoutUpdated` - Triggered when a checkout is updated
* `onOrderCreated` - Triggered when an order is created

# Go SDK
Source: https://polar.sh/docs/integrate/sdk/golang



Documentation coming soon.


# PHP SDK
Source: https://polar.sh/docs/integrate/sdk/php



A fully-featured PHP SDK for the Polar API.

### Quickstart

```bash Terminal theme={null}
composer require polar-sh/sdk
```

```php  theme={null}
declare(strict_types=1);

require 'vendor/autoload.php';

use Polar;

$sdk = Polar\Polar::builder()
    ->setSecurity('<YOUR_BEARER_TOKEN_HERE>')
    ->build();

$responses = $sdk->organizations->list(
    page: 1,
    limit: 10
);

foreach ($responses as $response) {
    if ($response->statusCode === 200) {
        // handle response
    }
}
```

[Read more](https://github.com/polarsource/polar-php)

### Sandbox Environment

You can configure the SDK so it hits the [sandbox environment](/integrate/sandbox) instead of the production one. You just need to set the server when building the client:

```php  theme={null}
$sdk = Polar\Polar::builder()
    ->setServer('sandbox')
    ->setSecurity('<YOUR_BEARER_TOKEN_HERE>')
    ->build();
```


# Python SDK
Source: https://polar.sh/docs/integrate/sdk/python



Fully type-hinted and allows both synchronous and asynchronous usage, thanks to [HTTPX](https://www.python-httpx.org/).
Under the hood, schemas are validated by [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/).

### Quickstart

```bash Terminal theme={null}
pip install polar-sdk
```

```python  theme={null}
# Synchronous Example
from polar_sdk import Polar

s = Polar(
    access_token="<YOUR_BEARER_TOKEN_HERE>",
)


res = s.users.benefits.list()

if res is not None:
    while True:
        # handle items

        res = res.Next()
        if res is None:
            break
```

[Read more](https://github.com/polarsource/polar-python)

### Sandbox Environment

You can configure the SDK so it hits the [sandbox environment](/integrate/sandbox) instead of the production one. You just need to add the `server` argument when instantiating the client:

```python  theme={null}
s = Polar(
    server="sandbox",
    access_token="<YOUR_BEARER_TOKEN_HERE>",
)
```

    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Quickstart

```typescript icon="square-js" index.js theme={null}
import { Polar } from '@polar-sh/sdk'

const polar = new Polar({
  accessToken: process.env.POLAR_ACCESS_TOKEN,
  server: process.env.POLAR_MODE || 'sandbox' // sandbox or production
})

async function run() {
  const result = await polar.users.benefits.list({})
  for await (const page of result) {
    // Handle the page
    console.log(page)
  }
}

run()
```

<Note>
  **camelCase vs. snake\_case**

  Our API (and docs) is designed with `snake_case`. However, our TS SDK currently
  converts this to camelCase to follow JS/TS convention. You should automatically
  see the camelCase parameters suggested in modern IDEs due to typing, but it's
  worth keeping in mind switching between code & docs.

  We aim to introduce the ability to toggle this in the future, i.e using
  `snake_case` even in TypeScript to more easily map it to our documentation and
  design of the API itself.
</Note>

Once a webhook endpoint is setup you will have access to the delivery overview
page. Here you can:

* See historic deliveries
* Review payload sent
* Trigger redelivery in case of failure

Now, let's integrate our endpoint route to validate, parse & handle incoming webhooks.

## Validate & parse webhooks

You now need to setup a route handler for the endpoint registered on Polar to
receive, validate and parse webhooks before handling them according to your
needs.

### Using our SDKs

Our TypeScript & Python SDKs come with a built-in helper function to easily
validate and parse the webhook event - see full examples below.

<CodeGroup>
  ```typescript icon="square-js" JS (Express) theme={null}
  import express, { Request, Response } from 'express'
  import { validateEvent, WebhookVerificationError } from '@polar-sh/sdk/webhooks'

  const app = express()

  app.post(
  '/webhook',
  express.raw({ type: 'application/json' }),
  (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  try {
  const event = validateEvent(
  req.body,
  req.headers,
  process.env['POLAR_WEBHOOK_SECRET'] ?? '',
  )

        // Process the event

        res.status(202).send('')
      } catch (error) {
        if (error instanceof WebhookVerificationError) {
          res.status(403).send('')
        }
        throw error
      }

  },
  )

  ```

  ```python Python (Flask) theme={null}
  import os
  from flask import Flask, request
  from polar_sdk.webhooks import validate_event, WebhookVerificationError

  app = Flask(__name__)

  @app.route('/webhook', methods=['POST'])
  def webhook():
      try:
          event = validate_event(
              body=request.data,
              headers=request.headers,
              secret=os.getenv('POLAR_WEBHOOK_SECRET', ''),
          )

          # Process the event

          return "", 202
      except WebhookVerificationError as e:
          return "", 403
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Both examples above expect an environment variable named `POLAR_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
to be set to the secret you configured during the endpoint setup.

### Custom validation

We follow the [Standard Webhooks](https://www.standardwebhooks.com/)
standard which offers [many libraries across languages](https://github.com/standard-webhooks/standard-webhooks/tree/main/libraries) to
easily validate signatures. Or you can follow their
[specification](https://github.com/standard-webhooks/standard-webhooks/blob/main/spec/standard-webhooks.md)
in case you want to roll your own.

<Info>
  **Note: Secret needs to be base64 encoded**

  One common gotcha with the specification is that the webhook secret is expected to be
  base64 encoded. You don't have to do this with our SDK as it takes care of the
  implementation details with better developer ergonomics.
</Info>

## IP Allowlist

If you are using a firewall or a reverse proxy that requires IP allowlisting, here are the IPs range you need to allow:

<Danger>
  **New IP ranges**

  Starting **October 27th, 2025**, new IP ranges will be added:

  ```
  74.220.50.0/24
  74.220.58.0/24
  ```
</Danger>

## Failure Handling

### Delivery Retries

If we hit an error while trying to reach your endpoint, whether it is a temporary network error or a bug, we'll retry to send the event up to **10 times** with an exponential backoff.

### Delivery Timeouts

We timeout our requests to your endpoint after **20 seconds**. Triggering a
retry attempt after a delay as explained above. However, we strongly recommend you optimize your endpoint route to be fast. A
best practice is for your webhook handler to queue a background worker task to handle the
payload asynchronously.

## Troubleshooting

### Not receiving webhooks

Seeing deliveries on Polar, but not receiving them on your end? Below are some
common techniques to resolve the issue depending on the reported error status.

**General**

*Start ngrok or similar*

Make sure you have started `ngrok` or whatever tunneling service you're using
during local development.

*Add excessive logging*

E.g
`console.log('webhook.handler_called')`,
`console.log('webhook.validate_signature')`,
`console.log('webhook.signature_validated')` etc.

So you can easily confirm if the handler is called and how far it gets before
any issues arise.

`HTTP 404`

* Try `curl -vvv -X POST <copy-paste-endpoint-url>` in your terminal to confirm the
  route exists and see any issues along the way
* Try adding trailing `/` to the URL on Polar. Often `/foo` is resolved to
  `/foo/` by frameworks.

`HTTP 403`

* Using middleware for authorization? Make sure to exclude the webhook route
  from it since it needs to be publicly accessible
* Using Cloudflare?
  * Check the firewall logs to verify if they are blocking our requests and setup a custom WAF rule to accept incoming requests from Polar.
  * Webhook delivery failures with 403 errors can occur when Cloudflare's Bot Fight Mode is enabled. Bot Fight Mode automatically blocks requests it identifies as bots, including legitimate webhook requests from Polar. Adding Polar's IP addresses to your IP Allow List or creating custom WAF rules will not resolve this issue. To fix webhook delivery problems, disable Bot Fight Mode in your Cloudflare dashboard under Security > Bots. Alternatively, you can check your Cloudflare firewall logs to confirm if requests are being blocked and create appropriate firewall rules if needed.

### Invalid signature exceptions

Rolling your own webhook validation logic? Make sure to base64 encode the secret
you configured on Polar in your code before generating the signature to validate
against.


# Setup Webhooks
Source: https://polar.sh/docs/integrate/webhooks/endpoints

Get notifications asynchronously when events occur instead of having to poll for updates

Our webhook implementation follows the [Standard Webhooks](https://www.standardwebhooks.com/) specification
and our SDKs offer:

* Built-in webhook signature validation for security
* Fully typed webhook payloads

In addition, our webhooks offer built-in support for **Slack** & **Discord**
formatting. Making it a breeze to setup in-chat notifications for your team.

## Get Started

<Info>
  **Use our sandbox environment during development**

  So you can easily test purchases, subscriptions, cancellations and refunds to
  automatically trigger webhook events without spending a dime.

    <Tip>
      **Developing locally?**

      Use a tool like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to tunnel webhook events to your local development environment. This will allow you to test your webhook handlers without deploying them to a live server.

      Once you have `ngrok` you can easily start a tunnel:

      ```bash Terminal theme={null}
      ngrok http 3000
      ```

      Just be sure to provide the URL ngrok gives you as the webhook endpoint on
      Polar.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose a delivery format">
    For standard, custom integrations, leave this parameter on **Raw**. This will send a payload in JSON format.

    If you wish to send notifications to a Discord or Slack channel, you can select the corresponding format here. Polar will then adapt the payload so properly formatted messages are sent to your channel.

Our webhook events and in which context they are useful

## Billing Events

### Checkout

  <Card title="checkout.updated" icon="link" href="/api-reference/webhooks/checkout.updated" horizontal />
</Columns>

### Customers

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="customer.created" icon="link" href="/api-reference/webhooks/customer.created" horizontal>
    Fired when a new customer has been created.
  </Card>

  <Card title="customer.updated" icon="link" href="/api-reference/webhooks/customer.updated" horizontal>
    Fired when a customer has been updated.
  </Card>

  <Card title="customer.deleted" icon="link" href="/api-reference/webhooks/customer.deleted" horizontal>
    Fired when a customer has been deleted.
  </Card>

  <Card title="customer.state_changed" icon="link" href="/api-reference/webhooks/customer.state_changed" horizontal>
    Fired when a customer's state has changed. Includes active subscriptions and
    granted benefits.
  </Card>
</Columns>

### Subscriptions

In order to properly implement logic for handling subscriptions, you should look into the following events.

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="subscription.created" icon="link" href="/api-reference/webhooks/subscription.created" horizontal>
    Fired when a new subscription has been created.
  </Card>

  <Card title="subscription.active" icon="link" href="/api-reference/webhooks/subscription.active" horizontal />

  <Card title="subscription.uncanceled" icon="link" href="/api-reference/webhooks/subscription.uncanceled" horizontal />

  <Card title="subscription.canceled" icon="link" href="/api-reference/webhooks/subscription.canceled" horizontal />

  <Card title="subscription.updated" icon="link" href="/api-reference/webhooks/subscription.updated" horizontal>
    Use this event if you want to handle cancellations, un-cancellations, etc. The
    updated event is a catch-all event for `subscription.active` ,
    `subscription.canceled`, `subscription.uncanceled` and `subscription.revoked`.
  </Card>

  <Card title="order.created" icon="link" href="/api-reference/webhooks/order.created" horizontal>
    In case you want to do logic when a subscription is renewed, you should listen
    to `order.created` and the `billing_reason` field. It can be `purchase`,
    `subscription_create`, `subscription_cycle` and `subscription_update`.
    `subscription_cycle` is used when subscriptions renew.
  </Card>

  <Card title="subscription.revoked" icon="link" href="/api-reference/webhooks/subscription.revoked" horizontal />
</Columns>

#### Cancellation Sequences

When a subscription is canceled, the events triggered depend on whether the cancellation is immediate or scheduled for the end of the billing period.

**End-of-Period Cancellation (default)**

When a subscription is **canceled** (by customer action from the portal or by the merchant from the dashboard/API), the following events are sent immediately:

1. `subscription.updated`
2. `subscription.canceled`

Both events contain the same subscription data. The subscription will still have `active` status, but the `cancel_at_period_end` flag will be set to `true`.

When the end of the current billing period arrives, the subscription is definitively revoked: billing cycles stop and benefits are revoked. The following events are then sent:

3. `subscription.updated`
4. `subscription.revoked`

Both events contain the same subscription data. The subscription will have the `canceled` status.

**Immediate Revocation**

When a merchant cancels a subscription with **immediate revocation**, those events are sent at once:

1. `subscription.updated`
2. `subscription.canceled`
3. `subscription.revoked`

All three events contain the same subscription data. The subscription will have the `canceled` status immediately.

#### Renewal Sequences

When a subscription is renewed for a new cycle, the webhook events are triggered in a specific sequence to help you track the renewal process and handle billing logic appropriately.

**Initial Renewal Events**

When a subscription reaches its renewal date, the following events are sent immediately (if enabled on the webhook):

1. `subscription.updated`
2. `order.created`

The subscription data will reflect the new billing period through the `current_period_start` and `current_period_end` properties, showing the updated cycle dates.

The order data represents the new invoice for the upcoming cycle, with a total representing what the customer will pay for this new period. If usage-based billing is involved, their consumption for the past period will be included in the total. The status of this order is `pending` at this stage.

**Payment Processing Events**

Shortly after the initial renewal events, the platform will trigger a payment for the new order. Once the payment is successfully processed, the following events are sent:

3. `order.updated`
4. `order.paid`

Both events will contain the same order data, with the order status changed to `paid`.

### Orders

## What is Polar?

Turn your software into a business with Polar. Sell digital products, subscriptions, and more without the hassle of traditional payment systems.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Beyond Payment Processing" icon="credit-card">
    Unlike Stripe that only handles transactions, we provide complete billing
    infrastructure with tax compliance, product management, and automated access
    & delivery.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Merchant of Record" icon="globe">
    We handle all international tax compliance, so you can sell globally without
    worrying about VAT, GST, or sales tax regulations.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Problems We Solve

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Tax Compliance Nightmare" icon="building-columns">
    **The Problem**: Selling digital products globally means dealing with VAT, GST, and sales tax in dozens of jurisdictions, each with different rates, rules, and filing requirements. Most developers either ignore this (risky) or avoid international sales entirely.

    **Polar's Solution**: As your Merchant of Record, we handle all international tax compliance. We calculate, collect, and remit taxes worldwide. You focus on building; we handle the paperwork.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Complex Billing Infrastructure" icon="gears">
    **The Problem**: Building subscription billing, product catalogs, customer portals, and payment flows from scratch takes months of development time and ongoing maintenance.

    **Polar's Solution**: Complete billing infrastructure out-of-the-box with APIs that let you integrate in minutes. No need to build customer portals, handle subscription lifecycle, or manage failed payments.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Manual Access & Delivery Overhead" icon="box">
    **The Problem**: Manually sending license keys, granting repository access, or managing Discord invites for every purchase doesn't scale and creates delays for customers.

    **Polar's Solution**: Automated benefit delivery for common developer needs - license keys, file downloads, GitHub repo access, Discord roles, and more. Customers get instant access.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="High Processing Costs" icon="money-bill">
    **The Problem**: Traditional MoR solutions charge 5-8% per transaction plus monthly fees, eating into your profits before you even start.

    **Polar's Solution**: 20% lower fees at just 4% + 40¢ per transaction with no monthly minimums. We earn when you earn.

## Restricted Businesses

Requires closer review and a higher bar of quality, execution, trust and compliance
standards to be accepted.

* Directories & boards
* Marketing services
* Pre-orders & Paid waitlist
* Ticket sales
* eBooks

## FAQ

**Why do directories & boards require closer review?**

They often sell premium placement, i.e ads, without meeting compliance
requirements for advertising. Or even where it's their sole purpose to sell
placement.

**Why do marketing services require closer review?**

Too many services offer sketchy marketing tactics and mass outreach
(unsolicited) features. There is no short-cut to sales beyond offering a great
product & service. We love marketing services that reflect that and focus on the
long game vs. shortcuts and hacks.

**Can I sell pre-orders or use paid waitlists for my service to validate demand
before build?**

Generally, no. It's a high risk category for us as the Merchant of Record.
Sellers could withdraw funds and never deliver the service or not as promised.
Causing consumers to demand refunds or dispute the sale against us at a later
date.

For high-trust cases from developers with a track record, we're able to make
exceptions, but simultaneously need to adapt our payout process to withhold all
funds until verified fulfilment.

**Why are marketplaces or human services (consultancy) not allowed?**

We hope to change this status quo amongst Merchants of Record long-term, but
both come with additional compliance and risk challenges. Since fulfilment is
not digital, immediate or between known parties to us, we cannot fulfil our
compliance & risk requirements or effectively mitigate potential disputes.

**Why are OnlyFans services not allowed?**

Close & blurred lines between the service and the content & service provided on
OnlyFans, i.e often adult content. In addition to us having seen
fraudulent & deceptive behavior in the category. We're simply not comfortable
acting as the Merchant of Record here.

Source: https://polar.sh/docs/merchant-of-record/account-reviews



As a Merchant of Record (MoR), we act as the reseller of digital goods and services. Therefore, we need to make sure that businesses using Polar complies with our [acceptable products & use](/merchant-of-record/acceptable-use) policies. Combined with continuously monitoring, reviewing and preventing fraud, unacceptable use, bad actors and high risk accounts.

Account reviews are typically completed within a week on average. However, sometimes it can take longer due to weekends, holidays etc. We process them as quickly as possible and resolve every single one.

### First payout review

You will need to go through our main review ahead of the initial payout. We’ll reach out over email for:

1. A quick survey about your business, products and intended use case with Polar.
2. Identity verification (KYC) using Passport/ID Card/Driver License and a selfie. It’s secure, easy and quick to submit using Stripe Identity.

We need to perform this review to ensure compliance with our [acceptable products & use](/merchant-of-record/acceptable-use) policy. Combined with meeting our own KYC/AML requirements as a billing platform.

**Submit upfront (Soon)**

We’ll soon offer the ability to submit all of this information in advance to speed up the initial payout even further and without concern of any issues or delays.

### Continuous reviews (Async)

We continuously monitor all transactions across our platform to proactively prevent fraud. In addition to performing asynchronous reviews of accounts at certain sale thresholds. These reviews are often completed within a day or two and without any additional information required from you.

You’ll get notified over email that a review is taking place. Payouts will be paused during this time, but it has no impact on your customers’ experience or ability to purchase, subscribe or checkout at any time.

We look at:

* Risk scores across historic transactions
* Refunds & Chargebacks ratio
* Appropriate next sales threshold for a review given the above

**High chargeback ratios**

Credit card networks, e.g Visa/Mastercard, consider 0.7% of sales in chargebacks excessive. Exceeding it can lead to monitoring programs with high costs, penalties and ultimately termination.

We therefore reach out proactively to collaborate on maintaining a low chargeback ratio and reducing it ahead of getting close to these thresholds.

## Operational Guidelines

To maintain platform integrity and ensure smooth operations, we have established clear guidelines for merchants using Polar.

#### Expected Responsiveness

We expect merchants to maintain high standards of customer support and responsiveness to their customers:

* **Support Ticket Management**: Maintain a low rate of support tickets from customers
* **Merchant Communication**: When we include you in customer support communications, we require a response within 48 hours
  * If no response is received within 48 hours, we may issue refunds to affected customers and a warning to merchants
  * In case of repeated issues, we'll have to offboard unresponsive merchants
* **Customer Service Quality**: We evaluate your customer service history and approach when determining appropriate actions

#### Test Transactions

To maintain platform security and prevent abuse:

* **Use Sandbox Environment or 100% Discounts**: All  testing must be conducted using our sandbox environment. Want to test in production? Use a Free Product or a 100% Discount code to avoid using real money.
* **No Real Money Testing**: Any such transactions are prohibited and will be refunded. It's against the terms of payment service providers, triggers our account reviews and can potentially lead to the card or account getting blocked since it can be flagged as "card testing".

#### Chargeback Management

We monitor chargeback rates closely to protect both merchants and customers:

* **Acceptable Threshold**: We maintain a chargeback rate threshold of 0.4% for merchants
* **Timeframe**: Chargebacks can be filed up to 120 days from the original transaction date
* **Consequences of High Chargeback Rates**:

  We work proactively to maintain a low chargeback rate throughout the platform and strive to collaborate with merchants at risk of exceeding our thresholds to reverse the trend. However, we reserve the right to (in order of severity):

  * Refund transactions as needed
  * Pause payouts pending review – up until the timeframe for chargebacks have been surpassed
  * Pause future payments
  * Block accounts and refund customers

  We don't take this responsibility or actions lightly, and always strive to mitigate and avoid them, but have to take appropriate and proactive actions in case of issues.

  <Note>
    We also have integrations with credit card networks to receive early chargeback signals before they're officially filed. We automatically refund such transactions under a certain value and cancel any subscriptions associated with the customer to reduce chargebacks proactively.
  </Note>

#### Policy Violations

For merchants who violate our [acceptable use policies](/merchant-of-record/acceptable-use) (and don't have high chargeback rates):

* **Immediate Action**: We will offboard merchants who violate our policies
* **Payment Processing**: All payment processing will be blocked
* **Payout Management**: Payouts will be paused pending review
* **Resolution Process**:
  * We may conduct test transactions to verify account status
  * In case of strong suspicion of fraud or intentional abuse, we block the account immediately
  * We reach out merchants about the issue and give them 48 hours to respond
    * Failure to respond may result in refunds to affected customers
  * We pause future payments in the meantime if deemed necessary
  * We pause payouts during the resolution process
  * We strive to collaborate with merchants on the best possible path forward. Clear fraud or abuse, however, is immediately blocked.
  * We have to cancel subscriptions and refund payments made in violation of our acceptable use policies for compliance and risk, and strive to do so in collaboration with the merchant.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why is my account under review again?

Your account may go through multiple reviews as your business grows. We perform [continuous reviews](#continuous-reviews-async) at certain sales thresholds to maintain platform integrity and prevent fraud. This is a standard practice across payment platforms and is part of our ongoing risk management process.

### Why do you need my social media in settings?

We request social media information as part of our identity verification and fraud prevention processes. This helps us:

* Verify that you're a real business or creator with an online presence
* Understand your products and services better
* Ensure compliance with our [acceptable use policies](/merchant-of-record/acceptable-use)

Providing accurate social media information helps speed up the review process and demonstrates the legitimacy of your business.

### Are social media settings visible publicly?

No, your social media settings are not publicly visible. This information is used internally for verification and compliance purposes only. We treat all merchant information with strict confidentiality and use it solely for risk assessment and account review processes.

### Why do I need to share a video recording showing the product working?

To help us verify that everything is working correctly in line with our acceptable use policy, our team would ask you to share a 100% discount code by email. This is our preferred method, as it allows the team to go through the full journey themselves and confirm the automated fulfillment from an unpaid user to a paid user.

Alternatively, you can provide a video recording that clearly shows the complete flow from an unpaid user to a paid user, including how the product is automatically accessible after purchase.

### How does changing the admin of an organization work?

To change the admin of an organization:

1. Invite the new admin to the team via `Settings` > `Members` in the Polar dashboard
2. Ask that new admin to complete identity verification under `Finance` > `Account` after logging in via that email in the Polar dashboard
3. Make sure no payout is pending
4. Send an email from the current admin email to our support confirming the transfer to the new admin

If you need assistance with changing organization ownership or have special circumstances, please contact [support@polar.sh](mailto:support@polar.sh).


# Fees
Source: https://polar.sh/docs/merchant-of-record/fees

Transparent fees at a 20% discount vs. other MoRs

## Transaction Fees

All transactions on Polar come with a small fee of 4% + 40¢ - applied to the entire transaction amount.

Polar is currently built on Stripe, and we cover their 2.9% + 30¢ fee from ours. However, they impose a few additional fees for certain transactions that we need to pass on.

### **Additional Fees**

* +1.5% for international cards (non-US)
* +0.5% for subscription payments
* *We also reserve the right to pass on any other fees Stripe might impose in the future*

**Example**

Let's look at an example breakdown with all these additional fees applied. Below is a payment of a \$30 subscription from Sweden (25% VAT).

| Item                           | Amount     |
| ------------------------------ | ---------- |
| Product Price                  | \$30       |
| VAT (25%)                      | \$7.5      |
| **Total Transaction Value**    | **\$37.5** |
| Transaction Fee (4% + 40¢)     | \$1.9      |
| International Card (+1.5%)     | \$0.56     |
| Subscription (+0.5%)           | \$0.19     |
| **Total Fees (Before Payout)** | **\$2.65** |

### Refunds

You can issue both full or partial refunds on Polar to your customers. However, the initial transaction fees are not refunded to you since credit card networks and PSPs charge them regardless of a future refund.

Please note: Polar reserves the right to issue refunds at our own discretion up to 60 days after the purchase as part of our efforts to continuously and proactively reduce disputes & chargebacks which costs you \$15/dispute. We only leverage this right for this purpose and in the interest of reducing chargebacks and fees for you.

### Dispute/Chargeback Fees

Sometimes, customers can open a **dispute/chargeback** via their bank for a purchase. **Disputes cost \$15 per dispute** regardless of outcome and is deducted from your balance directly. This fee is charged by the underlying credit card networks & PSPs regardless of outcome and therefore something we cannot refund.

However, we continuously work to proactively reduce the rate of chargebacks across Polar to be at or lower than industry standards.

Credit card networks impose monitoring programs, penalties and higher chargeback costs for sellers with high chargeback rates (\~0.7%+). Since Polar is the Merchant of Record, we therefore always monitor and proactively prevent our rate coming close to these thresholds.

Therefore, we might need to intervene and even suspend your account unless swift and proactive measures are taken to reduce chargebacks to an acceptable industry standard.

## Payout Fees

While payouts may incur fees charged by the payout providers (such as Stripe), Polar does not add any extra fees or markup. These are strictly the provider’s fees, and Polar does not profit from them.

In addition, Polar offers manual withdrawals for developers. Keeping you in control of when to issue payouts.

*Unless you have a Polar balance that you haven't withdrawn for several months, at which point we'll eventually need to trigger a payout on your behalf.*

**Stripe**

* \$2 per month of active payout(s)
* 0.25% + \$0.25 per payout
* Cross border fees (currency conversion): 0.25% (EU) - 1% in other countries.

**Open Collective (Deprecated for new users)**

* 10% on amount transferred

## Volume pricing

Large or fast-growing business? We can offer custom pricing to better fit your needs. [Reach out to us](/support).

Stripe and other Payment Service Providers (PSPs) offer an accessible and convenient abstraction to faciliate transactions on top of underlying credit card networks & banks.

* ✅ Powerful, flexibile & low-level APIs to facilitate transactions
* ✅ Can be used to power all business- and pricing models under the sun.
* ❌ You are responsible for all liabilities associated with transactions, e.g international taxes
* ❌ Low-level APIs require more development even for common use cases

**Merchants of Record (MoRs)**

Merchants of Record offer yet another layer of convenient abstraction to facilitate digital orders on top of the underlying PSPs and transactions. E.g Polar is built on Stripe (+ more PSPs in the future).

* ✅ Higher-level Dashboard, APIs & SDKs to better facilitate digital products, services & orders beyond the underlying transactions
* ✅ The platform (Polar) handles international taxes by being a reseller of your digital goods & services. Of course, without being in the way of your relationship with your customers.
* ❌ Less flexibility & control in terms of advanced business- and pricing models.
* ❌ Higher fees per payment

**What should you choose?**

**Ship with what you feel comfortable with vs. others tell you to**

Just like in programming, abstractions are super helpful to ship faster with fewer low-level concerns, but in exchange for reduced flexibility and higher costs. So what's the right level of abstraction for you? As always, it depends (tm).

**Go with Stripe (PSP) if...**

* You've already integrated it? Just ship already - we salute builders however they ship
* You're comfortable with the Stripe API and prefer absolute control with low-level APIs.
* You're looking for the lowest fees possible.
* You're fine with handling international taxes yourself (you absolutely can).

**Go with Polar (MoR) if...**

* You want product-, customer-, order- and subscription management via an intuitive and easy dashboard
* You want to offer file downloads, license keys, Discord- and/or private GitHub repository invites with ease - with more built-in automations to come.
* You prefer a more high-level API optimized for making monetization easier. We're only getting started here and have some big things coming
* You want us to handle international taxes for you

### Polar MoR

**We take on the liability of international sales taxes globally for you. So you can focus on building your passion. Leaving billing infrastructure and sales tax headaches to us.**

So how does Polar offer a Merchant of Record (MoR) service and handle international sale taxes? All other Merchants of Record simply state they handle it internationally - don't worry about it. We do too.

But we believe in transparency and don't want to scare customers into thinking it's impossible to manage it themselves. So below we'll share how exactly we go about doing this.

#### International Sales Taxes

Most countries, states and jurisdictions globally impose sales taxes on digital goods and services (VAT, GST, US Sales Tax etc). Regardless of whether the merchant (seller) is a resident there or not - they're doing business there.

For example, a \$10/month subscription should cost \$12.5/month for a Swedish (25% VAT) consumer, but \$10/month for a Swedish business with VAT registration (reverse charge).

Merchants are responsible for 1) capturing & 2) remitting sales taxes to the local tax authorities. What does that mean in our example?

1. **Capturing**. Charging the Swedish consumer \$12.5/month and saving \$2.5/month for the Swedish tax authorities. Stripe Tax is an excellent service to automate this and the one Polar uses today.
2. **Remitting**. Filing & paying the captured sales taxes with the tax authorities on time. Stripe Tax does not do this, i.e the merchant is liable to register, file and pay taxes to local tax authorities.

Many jurisdictions, however, don't require this until you reach a certain threshold in terms of sales volume. But others require registration even before the first sale - or after a very low threshold. In addition to having different rates and rules on which goods are taxable and whether they're deductable or not for business customers.

For example, United Kingdom and EU countries require upfront registration for international companies, but Texas (United States) does not until you've sold for more than \$500,000 🇺🇸🦅

In short: It's complex and hard. Even large and well-known businesses don't do it perfectly. Arguably, it's almost impossible and at least highly impracticle and expensive to comply perfectly upfront. Many companies even delay compliance as a calculated risk, i.e focus on validating & growing their business with the risk of paying back taxes + penalities later.

**PSP (Stripe)**

* ✅ Your volume alone is what counts towards international thresholds vs. the MoR platform, i.e customers might not need to pay sales taxes with you, but would via a MoR.
* ✅ You can deduct inbound VAT against purchases your business does with VAT
* ❌ You're liable for capturing & remitting international sales taxes
* ❌ Stripe Tax is great to monitor & automate capturing, but registration and remittance is up to you.

**MoR (Polar)**

* ✅ We are liable for all of the above as your reseller, i.e we have to worry about it vs. you.
* ✅ Offer EU VAT for B2B sales (expected and desired within EU for businesses) without having to register, capture and remit it yourself.
* ❌ Sales taxes would be added for more customers vs. with you selling directly
* ❌ You cannot leverage inbound VAT towards VAT expense deductions yourself

Merchants of Record (MoR) handles sales taxes, e.g US Sales Tax, EU VAT,
Canadian GST etc. **However, you're always responsible for your own
income/revenue tax** in your country of residency.

#### Polar Coverage

**We support global payments and are liable for all international sales taxes. We continuously monitor and work with our accounting firms to expand registrations as needed on our end.**

**Global Payments & Tax Liabilities**

As your Merchant of Record, Polar is liable for tax compliance globally on all sales internationally via our platform, hosted- or embedded checkoutsfrom payments anywhere in the world.

**Current Polar Tax Registrations**

1. Polar Software Inc. is incorporated as a US Delaware C Corp and will register for US State Sales Taxes upon reaching thresholds
2. EU VAT (Irish OSS VAT)
3. UK VAT

No Merchant of Record (MoR) or business registers upfront in all global jurisdictions. Since it would be 1) unnecessary in case of thresholds & 2) incredibly expensive with uncertain return on investment (ROI) in all markets.

We work with global accounting firms specialized in registering, filing and remitting taxes in all countries. So we can easily scale registrations and remittance as needed. Below is our process and evaluation for expanding registrations.

**Expanding Registrations**

Below are the fees the global acounting firms we work with charge us - on average per market:

* \~\$500 upfront for registration
* \~\$300 per filing and remittance (\~quarterly)
* *Excluding consultations (billed hourly) and our internal efforts and automations to transform Stripe Tax reports into correct output for the accounting firms.*

So on average \$1,700 in year one and \$1,200 therafter for each market at a minimum. Businesses (and you if you handle this yourself) therefore need to ask themselves: Do I anticipate more in sales from a given market vs. costs of operating there?

Let's imagine a country with 20% sales tax.

1. At \$6,000+ the tax liability start outgrowing the accounting costs for you standalone (\$1,200/20%)
2. Polar with a 1.1% premium vs. Stripe would need to help facilitate \$109,090 in sales for the given market in order for it to cover our accounting costs (\$1,200/1.1%)

Our customers are selling mostly in the US, UK & EU. Given US thresholds and our current registrations, it's therefore a non-issue.

In markets we're not registered, we still have the liability and take it on (#1) to assess the potential for our customers and us long-term. In addition to being comfortable betting on markets a lot earlier than it becomes profitable for us (#2).

However, in case of neither we reserve the right to block payments from such countries in the short-term until the opportunity for our customers and us changes in the given market.

**Want to do this yourself?**

Selling a lot and want to handle this yourself, i.e worth the ongoing costs? Feel free to reach out and we'd be happy to introduce you to our contacts at the accounting firms we use.

We consider MoR a key value-add to Polar, but not the sole reason for Polar to exist. Our ambition is to be the easiest way to monetize for developers. However, we're never going to be the right solution for all use cases. But we'll always salute and help anyone who ships software - regardless of billing platform.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is Polar's VAT number?">
    Polar's VAT number is `EU372061545`. This is an EU One Stop Shop (OSS) registration, which allows non-EU businesses like Polar (a Delaware C Corporation) to handle VAT for all EU countries through a single registration in Ireland.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why doesn't my accounting software recognize this VAT number?">
    OSS VAT numbers use the `EU` prefix instead of country-specific prefixes (like `IE` for Ireland). Some accounting software predates the OSS program or lacks support for this format. You can manually enter the number if your software allows overriding validation, or contact your software vendor to request OSS number support.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I use Polar in countries (e.g. India) where Stripe is invite-only?">
    <Note>Stripe Connect Express is a different product than the regular Stripe payments.</Note>
    Yes, any individual or company operating in our [supported countries](/merchant-of-record/supported-countries) can receive payouts from Polar even if Stripe standalone is invite-only there.

    This is possible as Polar is the Merchant of Record, all payments from customers are made to Polar (US). [Stripe Connect Express](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/express-accounts) is then used to issue payouts, and is supported in more countries via cross-border transfer than Stripe Payments standalone.

    You might still see a warning in Stripe Connect Express that payments are invite-only, but don't worry. No direct sales are made directly to the Stripe Connect Express account. They're all made to Polar (US) as a platform and the merchant of record. We only use the transfer and payout feature of Stripe Connect Express which is available in all of our [supported countries](/merchant-of-record/supported-countries).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use Polar as an individual to make sales globally?">
    Yes, given that Stripe Connect Express supports individual as a business type in your region.

    To know which business type is supported in your country, follow steps as below:

    * Open required [verification information](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/required-verification-information#US+RS+express+recipient+individual+transfers) by Stripe to set up a business or personal account in your country.
    * Ensure `Platform Country` is set to `United States (US)`.
    * Ensure `Dashboard Type` is set to `express`.
    * Ensure `Service Agreement` is set to `recipient`.
    * Ensure `Capability` is set to `transfers`.
    * Select the correct `Account Country` relevant to you.
    * Click on the toggle for `Business Type` which will allow you know if individual, business, company or LLC/LLP is supported by Stripe Connect Express in that region.
